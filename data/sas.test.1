You broke records . '
Mr. Leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college .
1 .
Not only does she care about school and doing her best , she cares about her family .
as it said in the r esults , it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree 's Celcius
The author organizes the aritcle by topic .
You would need to know what the samples are , how much of each are you would need .
The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm .
According to the text , `` A python swallowed an alligator . ''
This section defines what his main idea is about and gives the reader a better understanding about his topic .
These are the introduction , a section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
osmosis , which lets water in and out of the cell .
Also , that plastic A was the least stretchy .
Italso means itchanges the enviornmental chain .
^p B ) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging .
Mr. Leonard tells Paul he flunked out of college .
Third , i would need to know what type of container i should use .
Third , there is no control in this experiment .
Finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is .
A python in the everglades on 2005 was caught eating a alligator .
There were a few problems with this procedure .
Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul , i think Paul understood more .
I would also need to know the measurment .
She is always looking to the future .
What is Space Junk gives the reader an idea of the junk that 's in space .
Determine what the different samples are , then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample .
This is how pandas and koalas are different from pythons .
It 's a .
I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure .
This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems .
The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he could n't read .
It also allows the reader to know where specific details come from and find them very quickly .
After that , the auther explains hoe space junk occurs in 'Crash Course . '
The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement .
The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons .
They and both different from the pythons because can survive in more than one place . ''
Rose goes to school and has a part-time job .
Paul says in the passage , 'It 's time to start your training . '
This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab , she has all these thing to do .
Then the sections following that get more in depth and portray the seriousness of orbiting junk .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard feels the same way he does about reading .
Also , I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples .
above the Earth .
It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials .
The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course ' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space .
They are almost alike .
Dark colors do not reflect light well , instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures .
The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat , so it will keep the doghouse cooler .
Also , in the experiment , white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors .
The author organizes the article by sectioning it off into groups so we can understand the material .
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus , 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins .
An amino acid chain forms
Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him .
He could have added more that 's .
My hypothesis was correct plastic type ' A ' stretched the least during the experiment .
Crash Course talks about crashes of space junk and Little Bits , But a Big Deal talks about micro-debris .
Pythons are generalists , who are n't very specific in what they eat .
This would definitely improve the validity of their results .
In another he talks about what space junk is .
The first was space junk , that described what space junk is , and how it came about .
He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also .
This chain will be a protein .
a ) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics .
When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened , he felt for him .
The author organizes the article by starting with a introduction to grab the reader 's attention .
Pythons are generalist .
For example she says , 'Whats wrong ?
Look up in the sky !
If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties .
After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college .
You would also need to know what four samples to use .
To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data .
I n the lab , the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed .
She asks her sister what is wrong and if she feels okay .
What are the four different samples .
He starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk ' .
Active transport , unike passive , reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane .
In order to replicate this experiment , the group 's procedure should include more specific information .
^p The type of container for each substance .
An example of good orginaziton is that he dos n't get side tract .
Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself .
The second topic he has listed is crash course .
And I would also need to know what shape the samples are .
Also could have under control .
I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
He organizes this article by first talking about what space junk is .
So , that is an inspiration to Paul .
The narrator is amazed , and also moved by Mr. Leonard 's story .
This is how koalas and pandas are similar and differ from pythons . ''
This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it .
First , they did n't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor .
but with a unique spin .
There are many traits that describe Rose .
This trait is shown when she says , 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish college .
The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next .
All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm .
Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules ca n't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3 .
As a young child , Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning .
After confronting Mr. leonard about the information , Paul says 'Why did n't you tell me about this .
Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better .
Based on the student results , I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable .
The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills .
The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results .
You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same .
It shows Paul that he is not alone with his reading problem .
It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples .
Rose is a caring person .
100g or 50g or 10g .
A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with .
showing that she wants what is best for her brother .
For example this student said take a sample of one type , instead she cold have said whch one .
By doing this they are letting you know specific information about space junk .
4 .
Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him .
One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic .
I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach .
This would have made the experiment more conclusive .
Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him , he can be just like him .
Leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes .
Rose is very persistent .
Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b .
^p b ) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial .
Because the another are proliferating and hunting native specie .
Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material .
This is because it 's not supposed to live their and therefore altars the balance of the ecosystem .
Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college .
Next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things .
white : : The best paint color for the doghouse would be white .
This is easy enough to tell from her reaction when Anna walked into the room .
tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it .
NSR
The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3 .
You 'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample , and what the samples are .
The student could 've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were .
The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention .
It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm .
They eat only meat while the koala and panda do not eat only meat .
A ) In conclusion plastic type
During that paragraph he talks about satellites and what happens when they die or malfunction .
In the article pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college .
The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment .
I would also need to how much vinegars to put in the containers .
Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track .
4 .
Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me .
'No other school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours .
Like What Is Space Junk ?
How tiny debris can be a big deal and cause a mission to fail .
She loves her sister very much and you can see that by what questions she asked Anna .
In endocytosis , the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material .
When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard 's past track excellence , he becomes inquisitive , then empithetic .
Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college .
Also , we need to know what type of environment we should place this in .
The third process is called diffusion .
One trait that can describe Rose is supportive .
They should say what 4 samples are being tested , not just `` mass 4 samples '' .
When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard 's background , he instantly begins to look up to him .
Pual felt some sort of empathy because he knows what it 's like not being able to read well .
Naturally , he progressed how space junk developed into a problem for space explorers in 'Crash Course ' .
You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them .
The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it .
It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers .
The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic .
So , Paul decides to teach his teacher how to read once and for all .
Also the trials have different results of type A , from trial 1 plastic type A stretched .
Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials .
a . )
Finally , it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be .
The least stretchy would be type A , stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2 .
Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container .
I would also need to know to record the data and take observations .
Mr. Leonard 's background information had a large effect on Paul .
First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container .
Also , the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities .
They both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species .
They also do best when around humans .
They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother .
The cell can also use active transport to move substances .
It 's a ... tool bag ? ' .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists .
Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell .
Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest .
If it was cold , it would n't keep it as warm , but not super cold either .
They are both vegaterieuns .
Paul could sympathize with this feeling .
This talks about the seriousness of space junk .
This gives Paul hope that he can be good at something too .
^p b . )
I knew them well -- feelings of embarrassement ... ' .
For plastic type D , the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same .
It effects Paul , because he can relate to Mr. Leondard 's story .
In protein synthesis , after the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm .
So we could know how much it was before it stratched .
They are similar because they only eat one type of food . ''
Osmosis and diffusion are passively transport , meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy.3 .
Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type .
Pandas are specialist , meaning they dine on bamboo .
For example before 30 after 40 .
He gives you the background , or history , of Space Junk .
The author of this article starts with getting you intrested in what he has to say .
Next , under 'What is Space Junk ? '
when a coach hides something from you feel suspcious and want get in on the action .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
It 's a meteor ! .
They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container .
^p 3 .
In her conversation with Anna rose appears to be really hopeful .
You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Osmosis is moving water across a membrane .
The final section explains the dangers of space junk .
A ) From the data , I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable .
Plastic type B streched the most , in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm .
ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane .
Then it slowly goes into crash courses and how bad it effects our atmosphere .
She tells Anna , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring .
then there 's 'what Is Space Junk ?
Ehen Paul was reserching on Mr. Leonard , he found out the he to , could not read .
She asks her sister whats wrong when she walks in rubbing her eyes .
Causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense they 've been dubbed `` '' invasive '' '' . ''
^p b .
Do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple .
and a panda `` '' eat almost nothing but bamboo '' '' .
Based on the student 's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime .
He 's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before .
Type B though , streches the most .
Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items ?
white : : It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer .
He is touched by the fact that Mr. Leonard took his time to coach him into being better .
You need to identify what that sample .
There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard .
In the categorie called 'What is Space Junk ? '
white : : White would keep the dog house cooler .
Then he lets you know how much space junk is in space like satellites .
`` You need something like a scale to determine the mass .
Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing .
On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm .
Where as the python eats just about everything .
he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard 's words were all too familiar . '
It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass .
When Paul first discovers the shocking new information on Mr. Leonard , he is a bit confused .
Protein carriers also control movement of substances .
They should describe what the samples are , how much vinegar do you put in each container .
Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace .
Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back , not with money but with knowledge .
Mr. Leonard was great at track and lost his scholarship because he could n't read .
Rose is optimistic .
They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read .
Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic .
It shows Paul that being good at a sport isnt everything .
Right now , one can only guess what weight that was .
This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest .
Then there is another titled ' 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic .
Another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell .
a ) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not .
a ) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics .
For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black .
They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct .
It started off as the stretchiest , before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords .
Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon , the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed .
'What 's wrong ?
The author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained .
The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections .
I would need to know how much vine
She is always hopeful .
Paul is amazed .
if she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
In Crash Course the author is talking about the dangers of satellites colliding with each other .
^p b ) To improve validity/design , the student could have conducted more trials .
You need to know whether it should be in a cold , wet environment or maybe warm & dry .
They should have been more specific about their mass ( g ) of the weights used .
Also , I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not .
Pythons would probably eat any animal that it sees .
a : The more weights added to sample b and a , the more they stretched .
The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites .
Thirdly , they let you know that small problems are happening but it is a big deal .
He sees that he can not read , just like Mr. Leonard .
Rose is determined .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the same that they are both specialist species .
A ) In conclusion , plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial .
This information impacts Paul greatly in the story .
Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured .
My conclusion will be that with the added weight , the plastics stretched .
We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container .
I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be .
Than the aithor stresses the dangers of small free floating particles in space .
Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane .
However , he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college .
I can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister Anna .
The author organizes it in a way to make it easily understandable to the reader .
1 .
The scientist feels the term `` '' invasive species is unfair '' '' , referring to pythons .
Rose respects her elderes and doesnt want to hurt their feelings .
You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in .
Additional information that would be needed .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic .
Finally , the last section tells us how we can care .
white : : White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat .
the author explains what a satellite is and how they function .
They could have added more weight in the second trial .
This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer .
the student could 've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm .
The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard .
In the story , Paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader .
The articel being organized helps the reader stay interested and understand better .
Third , the author discusses how satellites collide with each other .
It does n't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups .
he was shut out because he could n't read .
3.a ) In conclusion , plastic sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability .
How much water do you rinse them with and for how long ?
Based on the student 's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount .
You pr obably do n't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white .
The author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by 'Grab your telescope !
In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container .
Then he puts the information into different catagories .
In the article it says that pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Mr. Leonard was just like Paul at his age .
She also mentions to Anna how her father has to work hard to send Paul to college .
Rose wants to be the big person .
The third and final section in about little pieces but a big deal .
He describes the outter space , with all of the trash floating around in it , from previous astronotes .
He does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact .
During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
Mr. Leonard use to be a big track star .
They also could have been more detailed about how much weight , they were adding to the plastic .
Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first .
You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after .
That would make the hypothesis more true .
these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites .
All these things are essential to replicating this experiment .
Also , he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew .
The author tells us that Mr. Leonard smiled sadly after realizing what it was .
You would also need to have the samples all the same size .
Could have had 3 trials .
Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading .
Should the samples be placed in a beaker graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container ?
^p B . )
And koalas only eats eucalyptus leaves .
Then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk . '
You would need to know how much wood , limestone , marble , and plastic you would need .
The word invaisive is significant to this article .
It 's very vague , so they should add more specific .
A trait you can see Rose has it that she is very respectful of her family .
Rose puts her family before herself .
In the introduction , the author states that space junk is a great concern to government space agencies .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different because the China pandas eats nothing but bamboo .
You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change .
The author first talks about what is the Earths autmosphere can handle and what we may see out there .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard ca n't read just as Paul ca n't .
This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of .
The author starts with the simple question 'What Is Space Junk ? '
^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic .
So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
These additional steps would make the procedure better .
The backround information effected Paul because they both had things in common .
white : : the white had the lowest temp .
a .
It is a very helpful way in letting us find information on a given idea .
a .
The mRNA lands on the rRNA and waits for the tRNA to bring amino acids .
It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems .
) How much vinegar should go into each container ?
C went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out I guess .
The website tells Paul that Mr. Leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college .
The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid .
Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy .
The author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk .
The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2 .
^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample ( when it go inside - absorb ) .
a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers .
Mr. Leonard had trouble with reading but at his school , they did n't have a learning center .
( 2 ) The mRNA is then read by the ribosome .
Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use .
The author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion .
The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic .
The author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites .
Type C stretched 14 ( mm ) on the first trial and 13 on the second .
One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial .
The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container ?
They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples .
Plus they are both track hurdlers too .
In the article called 'Crash Course ' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008 .
^p B .
That will improve the results . ''
Invasive is the right word to describe these actions . ''
An example of this was when the python ate the alligator .
tRNA then attaches to the mRNA , matching its bases to those of the mRNA .
So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table .
The least amount stretched was plastic a .
These are information 's I need to replicate the procedure .
Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard felt when he had to read or did n't know answers .
Finally the author describes how tiny fragments can hurt .
' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration .
white : : The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler .
Paul seen this and was encouraged by this becasue he was like Mr. Leonard .
The author of 'Orbiting Junk ' organizes the article into four sections .
He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he ( Paul ) was feeling .
It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy .
Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer .
I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher .
Paul was also confused .
For example , it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk .
The cause for this is to have everything more organized .
They should 've also done more trials on the other types of wrap .
Became on the track team .
optomistic .
Second , you need a control for comparison purposes .
or my results may vary .
Rose is loyal to her family .
Rose feels responsible to help her brother .
and 'Crash Course ' These titles help us understand the things the author is trying to explain .
After defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made .
^p b .
The author starts by getting the reader 'excited ' .
The author starts by explaining to us about the concern of space junk .
Also they should do another trial and then average out the results .
The author organizes the article by different concerns .
And they should keep the weights on for longer , this will give more extensive and accurate data .
Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar .
^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials .
( a ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most .
This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by .
Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this .
Lastly , you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at .
They are different from the python because pythons eat almost anything .
Then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris .
The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic .
Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills .
He continues to ask , 'Well , what happened after that ?
This makes the article very easy to read and to understand .
This takes more energy from the cell , and may use enzymes to quicken the process .
Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use .
^p 3 . )
The effect , on Paul , about discovering the background information on Mr. Leonard is empathy .
Lastly , you need to know what temperature to store them at .
I would need to know how much of each material will be needed .
This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples .
Pandas and koalas have alot more in common that meets the eye .
Having all plastic pieces be the same length .
A .
In other words , pandas and koalas are not something to really worry about unlike pythons .
Then , the author explains how it gets dangerous .
The background information that paul gets about Mr. Leonard allows him to relate to him more .
It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites .
When Mr. Leonard informed Paul of his reading disability , Paul sympathized with Mr. Leonard 's emotions of embarrassment .
white : : the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot .
Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA .
This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was .
Neither of them change their diet which , for koalas is eucalyptus leaves , and for pandas , bamboo .
The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem , despite the small size of the debris .
The three topics are 'What Is Space Junk ?
He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him .
But with black i t attracts the sun .
Rose cares very deeply about others .
Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner , and that he broke many records .
Each of these titles informs you about what your going to be reading about in the pargraph below .
A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm .
Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container .
What kind of container ?
In order to replicate the groups experiment , I would need a lot of additional information .
Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with , and how .
They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one .
Paul made a great friend that day .
Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic .
Paul is implying he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane .
Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic .
The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say .
white : : White will affect the dog house by making it cooler .
Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings .
He emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space .
To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things .
He keeps it simple , but also interesting for the readers .
Finally in the last paragraph , the reader talks about how scientists are trying to solve the problem .
A. based on the results , I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest .
For example , the first section , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse .
Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from .
The procedure should also encourage repetition .
The author then writes about how it is harmful to space and our environment .
B .
