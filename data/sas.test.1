the author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about
as the article states in paragraph the snakes have imperiled endangered species in the florida keys
she tell anna that their brother will get a job after college to pay for their college education
then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling
those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space
the author divides the article up into separate sections
the ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container
with sections having titles what is sapce junk and then having information under the section titles
cmon mr leonard its time to start your training
really thoughthey are just animals trying to survive
both are different from pythons because pythons are generalists who can live in most climates
an example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance
once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell paul i think paul understood more
the student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison
i would need the amount of roch in each container
how would also need to know if they used the same size cup
black black will absorb more heat therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year
caring rose says we have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job
also they should of used the same amount of weights
on the website he sees someone he has grown close to
also the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities
her family comes first in everything she does
they both only eat one kind of food bamboo or eucalyptus leaves
protein carriers also control movement of substances
the author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article
i also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when i am waiting hours
the auther organized the thoughts with ledgible headings such as what is space junk
white white is the best color to use for the doghou se
it also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star
mr leonard helped paul excel and feel like he was worth something
paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because mr leonard cant read like paul
this would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating
the author starts off the passage with a comical line grab your telescope
the author organizes the article in three sections
i would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size
the author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next
paul finds out that mr leonard cant read just as paul cant
diffusion is a high concentration to a low concentration
the author makes these description in the paragraphs of crash course
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both furry mamals
one trait that can describe rose is respectful
paul can relate to how mr leonard felt when he had to read or didnt know answers
the author organizes the article with little articles in it
the author organizes the artice by putting the information into three different sections
black the black paint would absorb heat
and i would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ
also they shouldve used a control plastic to compare their results to
from this part of the story i felt that she was caring
therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse
therefore the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment
to be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things
white because it had lowest temp after minutes w hich is degc
also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested
so we could know how much it was before it stratched
the snakes are unwelcome unless kept in captivity
so the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside
the next section explains to readers what space junk is
i would need to know how much vinegar i am pouring into each container
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia they only eat one thing
this is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem
you need to know whether it should be in a cold wet environment or maybe warm dry
in order to reciprocate this experiment exactly
aunt kolab cares about anna and she knows when something is wrong with her
the introduction being attention to the atricle and makes you wonder about space junk
white they should use the white color because white doesnt heat up as fast
i would need to know how big each individed
he cant rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college
in the experiment the results show that the darker the color the warmer it is inside
i do not however believe these results are valid
in the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space
both are very well runners but fail to excel in school
protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop
state how long you are rising the materials in water
plastic type b stretchable most mm in t mm in t
pandas and koalas are both specialists
another improvement couldve been to tell us the type of plastic for recreature of the experiment
paul confronted mr leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend
under crash course he talks about satellites and their possibilities of crashing or becoming a freeorbiting satellite
in warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar
plastic type a has the worst stretchability
she understands why there papa had to leave
with this information i am certainly capable of repeating the experiment
rose said only if you already have everything
lastly we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the hour time period
rose is a very giving and thoughtful person
how much vinegar was put into every cup
finally i would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment
pandas and koalas are both similar because they can only survive in certain areas
i believe by organizing it this way it leads to a more effective and more interesting article
how long the samples how much the vinegar at how big should containers be
chinas panda and australias koala are similar because they eat the same thing constintly
the learned information also shows paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative
they should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched
to replicate the groups procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container
mr leonard had assisted paul and now paul wanted to assist mr leonard by tutorong him in readingcomprehension
active transport requires energy this may use transport protiens
provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly
the one trait i think that describes rose is that she is caring
shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp
paul finds out about mrleonards past and is surprised
the independent variable is the type of plastic
in the last paragraph paul wants mr leonard to start training
paul who we know cant read turns out to be a great athlete but cant read
white was only degrees and black was degrees
in return paul is willing to teach mr leonard how to read
they also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length
another would be to make the procedure more understandable
yhe job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
this would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use
this process is when water is transported across the cell membrane
it connects with the ribosome and then trna comes and connects with the ribosome
the student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps
i would also need to know what the samples are
i would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup
when paul discovers mr leonards past track excellence he becomes inquisitive then empithetic
each section has a main focus but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris
the trna reads the mrna and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mrna
for example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively
then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing and how it is a huge problem
i would also need to know how much vinegar should use it doesnt state it clearly
after reading this procedure i have noticed that i would need to know the ph of the vinegar
the author organizes the article by seperating different subjects under subtitle
in t it got to and in t it got to
the thrid one is all about satellites colliding together and creating space junk
in the last sentence paul says cmon mr lenoard
firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material
it also allows the reader to know where specific details come from and find them very quickly
the background information that paul gathers about mr leonard is that he use to be a college track star
first the amount of vinegar would be needed
it started off as the stretchiest before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords
mr leonard trained paul so now paul wants to train mr leonard to read
one would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container
the author organized the article in a unique way
the author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk
paul and both mr leonard cant read but they both excel in jumping hurdles
i would have to know whatknd of samples to use
based on the students data it can be concluded that plastic type b has the best elasticity
they are both different from the python by the python eat other animals and animal populations begin to dwindle
in the store it states pythons are imperiling live endangered species in the florida keys
rosa said to anna whats wrong you feel okay
he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like what is space junk
paul wanted to help out mrleonard just like mrleonard help him out
this is proven by the data gathered by the trials
they should be more clear about how to rinse each sample
rose says its only been four months he had to go
to replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get
the protein channels allow certain things to come through
she went from school straight to her work and then right back home to help her aunt
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers
the size of the container needs to be determined
it effects paul because he can relate to mr leondards story
also step should be switched with step
paul was suprized at what mr leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out
lastly i would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with
paul is surprised that mr leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in high school
it would also be helpful to know the size of the container size of the sample to use
he helps him to read better because of the help mr leonard provided him in the hurdles
white the dog house will not be to hot
therefore that is how the author organizes this article
black this color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors
i would also need to how much vinegars to put in the containers
this statement by rose expresses her work ethic
mr leonard tells him i was a good athlete but not a good enough student
this paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous
one piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers
thats why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm
the chain of amino acids create a protein
in conclusion some of the plastics stretched more than others however all of them did stretch
mr leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what paul had
pythons can eat any thing while pandas and koalas cant adapt
first the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers
he found out that he wont the meter hurdles at the nationals and that mr leonard broke records
they use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared
the adaptability of the python makes it different from koalas and pandas
how much vineger do you have to pour into each container
the auther organizes the articles by titles about what he wants to talk about
the author starts by explaining to us about the concern of space junk
how should the samples be removed from the container
like paul mr leonard was not a very good reader as made apparent by his college background
thats why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment
pythons eat anything like when a python swallowed an alligator andexploded
to replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing
it shows paul that he is not alone with his reading problem
to begin the author grabs the readers attention with an interesting introduction
he tells about what is causing space junk and why
these results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes
she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late
the author organizes the article by starting with an attention getter
no college wanted someone who couldnt read
when paul heard that they had something in common and he knew how to relate to him
he had lost his scholarship though because he couldnt read
they when paul figured out that mr leonard flunked out of college paul knew felt his pain
macinnes however says that calling these species invasive is passing judgement
australian koalas and chinese pandas seem a world apart
the author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous
rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate
all of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment
they give more facts and number that we can not ignore
the average temperature is degc which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures
rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like mama
it is important to keep your constants constant
first of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab
they also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic
they would need to know which substances to use how much of each one
she does this to save her aunts and mothers feeling so they are not dissapointed in her
an example from the article is in the everglades in a python swallowed an alligator
in order the replicate the experiment you need
just saying samples is not specific enough
it gives us examples like in paragragh about the lost tool bag
the student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added
she is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future
when anna walks in the room she immediately asks her what the matter is whats wrong
if you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm
paul does not feel sorry for him just simply wants to help him as his friend had helped paul
diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient without the need for energy
next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there
i need to know what the four starting samples are
the student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and if needed a fourth
these require atp for energy to pass the substances through the membrane
also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design
paul was effected by mrleonard because paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed
some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in
the conclusion i got for the lab is that there cant be one
he uses sub headings such as what is space junk and crash course
in this experiment students tested to see
next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious
after that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal
paul learns that mrleonard was very good at track in college
next the cytoplasm that has the mrna in it will attach to a ribosome
but she is doing what she can to make the best of it
mr leonard wamted the narrator to succeed because of what happened to himself
the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions
through this data recorded from the experiment we can conclude that plastic a had the strongest polymer setup
plastic type b had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials
the effect that paul gets when he gets the backround information on mr leonard was shcok and disbelief
mrleonard gave his time to help paul succeed at something
plastic b was stretched to an average of
then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination
the most stretchable would be plastic b
they both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species
they could have taken some time of step and did one to two more trails
once grabbing the readers attention he breaks the article into several segments labeled what is space junk
polymer b is the most stretchable plastic
also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used
this causes an unbalance in the ecosystem
they could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was
the student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer
pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo so they are not harmful
then the author explains how it gets dangerous
the author uses the introduction to get the point across
in active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration
that is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk
after all mr leonard had helped paul discover that he could excel in hurdles
black painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most
one ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials
crash course and little bits but a big deal
osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane
in the introduction the author opens with a surprising statement of a toolbag in space
the author beings the article with an attention graber to introduce what the rest of the article will include
the only thing he was good at was track
the next section entitled what is space junk
they need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format
the article says that invasive species are a threat to biodiversity
in step it says pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers
those are the information that you would need to do this experiment
in case there was no data table present
next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things
in china pandas are similar to koalas in australia because they are specialists
they both cant read but are willing to try and get better at anything
b the students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched
the introduction which was to get the reader interested
the reader gets background information about mr leonard
mr leonard teaches paul the lesson of nothing is impossible without determination
they also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it
mr leonards background information effected paul by making him realize that he and mr leonard are similar
they also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container
in the story paul is confused when mr leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes
the similarities between pandas and koalas is they dont eat meat
two you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container
cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane
the length of the plastic samples should also be the same
these animals are usually thought of as harmful to the environment it lives in
so paul sees the similaritys between mr leonard and him with reading
the author organizes the article by makeing chapter like sections about different details
if we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse
each section relates to the main idea which is that there is waste orbiting in space
then he has a subtitle that says what is space junk
add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic
how big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using
also adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment
on the website he finds out about mrleonard being a college runner in the meter hurdles
last the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change
when anna wakes up from a bad dream rose checks on her and asks her whats wrong
the in the section what is space junk
paul listened to mr leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present
paul feels like he needs to help mr leonard after what he did for paul
the trna brings amino acids that link together to form a protein
we had no learning centers in our school
lastely it talks about how loosing space trash is serious matter
pandas in china and koalas in australia are what the article calls specialists
the background information about mrleonard motivated paul and encourage him of working harder
after copying the dna sequence mrna leaves the nucleus of the cell
it confuses paul because mrleonard didnt seem happy about seeing the printout
mr leonard although not able to read was successful at other things including track
she also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away
also you would need to how to determine mass
in sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one
and a panda eat almost nothing but bamboo
white using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day
however he found out that mr leonard had flunked out of college
to replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment
the mrna will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a trna with complimentary bases
also we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples
white the color white might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest
when paul learned that mr leonard was once a track star paul was shocked it seemed
and while helping him it would also improve pauls reading skills
the author organizes this article in a simple yet effective way
paul learns that mr leonard was a poor reader just as paul is
the significance of the word invasive is that these reptiles are called invasive
paul was happy that he made a new friend in mr leonard
when a coach hides something from you feel suspcious and want get in on the action
finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup
pandas and koalas are both endangered animals
i would need these pieces of information so i can repeat this experiment
then in the section what is space junk
in the second section crash course the author tells you about the risks of the dead satellites
a passive transport uses little or no energy
where as the python can adapt and it does not rely on only one food source
for example the header stating what is space junk
it allows water in and out without trouble
the author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere
mr leonard also helps paul not feel like an outcast
and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest
paul responds by offering mr leonard training
have a determined size for the starting samples of rock
conclusively plastic type b tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples
validity of the results bys i specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and
and two taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type
the students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table
the person lets you know what the sections are about
another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels
the author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of
this is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment
neither of these require energy for the cell to use
differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data
in order to replicate this experiment more information is needed
paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for mr leonard too
this brings a closeness and a sense of empathy to paul
a trait you can see rose has it that she is very respectful of her family
the koala which lives in australia only eats eucalyptus leaves
she is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is
that is why she is a very giving person
the students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results
al so white looks much better on houses than black dark grey or light gre y
this tells us pandas cant adapt to other places like pythons
in this groups procedure they do not state what
also use the same amont of weights for each plastic
he seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades
for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk
first of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container
the first one entitled what is space junk
put two clamps instead of tape bc the tape may evert its own force while the clamps wont
how does the author title the article he titles is to help the reader
while she works she still keeps up on school work and helps her aunt cook for the family
three trials can help make this definite
the last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be
like in the article what is space junk
in the article pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
the mrna leaves the nucleus through a small hole only sizable for it
also in the table include how much each weights were added on
there is a deg difference between the black and white colored lid
paul finds out that mr leonard was also a track star and he is in amaze
i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers
he also could have done more trials with each type of plastic
white white will affect the dog house by making it cooler
first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere
plastic type a was the least stretchable
for example i would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample
the author organizes this article in three different sections
the polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type a
the panda mainly eats bamboo as the koala maily eat eucalyptus leaves
she also mentions to anna how her father has to work hard to send paul to college
paul was concerned about why mr leonard never told him about this
active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration
another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials
it also presents some of the problems caused by space junk
and he said i lost my scholarship and flunked
the background information makes paul feel more confortable with mr leonard
paul knows how if feels to not be able to read
but once he got to college his friends werent there to help him out anymore
theyre both good athletes who have trouble reading
the next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk
the darker the lid the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat
the containers reapetedly separate but identicle conatainer
both species are specialists they have adapted to certain conditions havea hard time with change
they did not specify what type of container or how large
other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type
the author then goes into an explanation of what space junk is and why it poses a threat
a plastic type b was the stretchiest and plastic type a was least stretchiest
the embarrassment when he didnt know the answer
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
when paul discovers about mr leonards struggle to learn paul feels a connection with him
from the data presented that plastic type b can be stretched the farthest
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they both mostly eat leaves
in fact he won the meter hurdles at the nationals and borke many of records
plastic type b is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested
crash course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher
how much vinegar is needed in each dish
he had finally found someone who in all reality was just like him
the also should have had a control which woud have been the plastic with the weights
also the students should have specified the weight being used
pauls opinion of mr leonard changes for the better
she didnt answer her aunt because she didnt want to hurt her
diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides
unlike pandas koalas a python eats whatever it sees for example one ate an alligator
you would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with
paragraph says cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward the school
what were the weight of the weights that were used
mr leonard was a star in college and wanted paul to suceed
also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top
the final section explains the dangers of space junk
after that he tells how this space junk is formed
then by titleing the section what is space junk
the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves
so they have to stay in specific habitats to survive
i also would need to know how many trials were their
i would also need to know how big each sample should be
a conclusion on could draw is that plastic type b has the most stretchability
plastic type b stretched mm the first trial and mm the second trial
pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
he is also empathetic towards mr leonard
the effect it had on paul was to want to help mr leonard with his reading ability
the segments formed by the mrna are called codons
next they could have said how long each plastic had to be
panda and koala bears differ from pythons based on what they eat
when mr leonard first tells paul about what he used to be paul was filled with unbelief
he reailzed that he was in the same position as mr leonard
the order is from most shotely to least b d c a
plastic type d stretched mm in tand t
paul can relate to mr leonard in many ways
also to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be
it is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table
one might also want to know what type of container how to write down the findings
a my conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic b has the highest stretchability
paul seems very suprised that mr leonard was a track and hurdle runner
rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away
for example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic
the student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic
active transport unike passive reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane
we know that plastic type b stretched the furthest
he understands why he was helping him out with the hurdles
mr leonard flunked out of college because he couldnt read nobody really helped him
the first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion
in fact the comparison is nothing alike
next the author explains the main topic and what exactly space junk is
mr leonard didnt have a learning center back then that would help him with his grades
a the more weights added to sample b and a the more they stretched
lastly he concluds by proposing a sollution to this problem
active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens
the second topic he has listed is crash course
at the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone
based on the student results i can conclude that plastic type b is the most stretchable
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because both animals do best around humans
the order of the information makes sense in the human mind
when rose is talking to anna she shows that she is selfless
the procedure does not state what the four samples they are testing
the way paul can relate to mr leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes paul a little emotional
the author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading
the background information about mr leonard has a staggering effect on paul
how much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use
first he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance
this energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell
the author starts out by telling the reader that a tool bag is floating in space
pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists
the plastic type b stretched the most out of all the other plastic types
the author explains what a satellite is and how they function
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because
paul is not exactly an average boy he doesnt really fit in and he can not read
the invasive species invade and arent imbalance in ecosystems
this investigation shows that plastic b stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment
i think that when someone puts someone elses feelings or thoughts before their own is a careing person
white the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler
the size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
rose is very respectful and conconcious about others feelings
an what type of vinegar i would be more specific
by not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid
this is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane
little bits but a big deal those bits of space debris present a very serious problem
they are not limited on food like pandas and koalas are
the procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment
the section crash course refers to the event of a russian and american satellite running into one another
so to me i think black would be the best color
after the conversation with aunt kolab she was confident that her life could get easier
according to the students data plastic type b is the most flexible of the plastic types
type c stretched mm on the first trial and on the second
mr leonard was a track star ut he could not read
no school wanted a runner who couldnt read
they differ from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live anywhere
pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo achenbach
he follows this up by giving us a brief history of space junk
with these pieces of information i could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results
describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space
the author starts off with a piece of space junk in the air
it wouldnt be to hot or to cold for the dog
the code aug means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis
in the story our narrator paul finds some background information on mr leaonard
when she finished those tasks she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion
they are also different from pythons because of the weather climate that pandas and koalas live in
he she talks about space junk and how it effects our admisphere and the rocketships in space
therefore states that pandas and koalas are different
there is the introduction followed by the three subtitles what is space junk
a second way he couldve improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used
another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table
the word invasive describes how dangerous reptiles are becominginvasive through out
he organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you
osmosiswater through the cell membrane
they could have said how much werent they used
another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down
another way to give a hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both require special native food
also they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion
both differ from the pythons who snacks on rodents birds and the occasional alligator
mr leonard cant read but was a very good athlete
the second section explains how all of this space junk has gotten there
the second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with d water
they could have added more weight in the second trial
we also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers
for example one section is what is space junk
mr leonard gave his time to help paul excel
rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education
osmosis which lets water in and out of the cell
this would definitely improve the validity of their results
all of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment
the third section describes the dangerous collisions that take place in space between the different satellites and such
four what temperature the samples be kept at for hours
diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low
more specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here
the procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times
the information paul soon recieves from mr leonard has a great impact on him
koala bears and pandas are very much alike
rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood
also they should have included before and after length in their design table
black the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy
she knows that she has a role in her family
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
they also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant
a i conclude that plastic type a stretched the mostml
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are specialist for their countries
facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane
i would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a rd trial
he knows that even if he cant read like everyone else he can still be good at something
the size of the containers you are using
and what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample
it also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers
rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings
lastly you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at
paul learned that mr leonard was a track star who also couldnt read
you need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with
specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic
the author first begins with an introduction to what the article will be about
plastic d stretched the second most with an average of mm and then plastic with average mm
this does require energyosmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane
after reading the procedure some things are still unclear
as long as the climate is right they can adjust and find food
the background information causes paul to feel closer to mr leonard
secondly it tells you the risk and chances of satellites colliding with each other
the length of the plastics need to be kept constant
this type of transportation does use energy because it goes against the flow
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists
according to the students data plastic type b is the strongest
the mrna comes to the ribosme where then the dna is decoded by trna
the author organizes the article from the basics of space
this section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the earth
the author organizes the article by first stating that space junk can be dangerous
another process is using a protein channel
to emphasize the seriousness of space junk he relates facts about real crashes that have occured
b stretched on average mm while the other three ranged from mm
these opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful
he wondered why mr leonard didnt tell him this
in this experiment students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability
also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples
type b stretched mm on the first and on the second
in order to figure out how to replicate this i would need to know the containers size
i would also need to be able to know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample
the author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph what is space junk
if the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected
other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings
the protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids
then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs
there were a few problems with this procedure
determine the mass of four samples of what
but if you were to use black or dark gray it would keep the dog house warmer
what type of vinegar and does temperature matters
paul looks at mr leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past
the temperatre was deg and the hight was the black at deg
rose is trying to be very optimistic during her conversation with anna
some additional information you will need are the material
heshe also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics heshe was measuring
so if the roof is white the dog will too cool
rose is a hard worker and worries a lot
something to warm would not be suitable for a dog and therefore making white the right color
mr leonard had went through school not knowing how to read
which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse
mr leonard was only givin a scholarship based upon his sports not his grades
these amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mrna
material type b stretched about mm more than a
the control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes
light gray using light gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate
plastic c stretched only a bit more than plastic a
the author first begins on getting attention and becoming interested in this article
a conclusion could be that plastic type b had the best results for strechability with m and m
lastly we need to know the concentration of the vinegar
section in the soviet union lunched the first artificial satellite
the introduction uses humor to convey the topic
paul asks mr leonard about why he never told him
the effect that the background information on mr leonard had on paul was he wanted to help
paul also finds out that mr leonard failed out of college because he could not read
however they vary from a python because a python can live numerous places throughout the world
the author organizes the article by putting it into specific sections
therefore one can see rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful
also i would need to kno how much vinegar is needed
they are very different to pythons which are generalists
mr leonard like paul had trouble reading
i would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample
paul wants to help mr leonard like mr leonard helped him
with passive transport the cell wont have to use any energy to move the substance
during the story paul gets background information about mr leonard
how much vinegar would you pour in each cup
diffusion when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area
the students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results
paul also understood how mr leonard felt embarrassment and the longing to be like other kids
th e white was the lowest average tempatue a degc
one detail from the story that shows this is when her sister walked in rubbing her eyes
it exploded but it still tried to eat it
the author starts by explaining what the problem is in the section what is space junk
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
this statement shows paul understood how mrleonard felt
how much sample to add into each solution
one treat that can describe rose would be positivety
paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for mr leonard
both the chinese pandas and australia koalas are specialists
in the final section they explain how the space garbage can cause complications for spacecraft
the person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample
also about how america and russian satellites crashed into eachother right about earth
in the first trial plastic type a stretched mm and in the second trial it stretched mm
in another he talks about what space junk is
these example show that rose is a very hard worker
this story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you
plastic a was the strongest because it stretched the least
additional information that would be needed
they share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them
the author then goes into detail about launching the first satellite
because maybe the put or did different procesure
he begins with space junk which tells about junk and satellites
the group neglected to include what the four different samples are
also plastic type a is the least flexible
he seperated it into three diffrent sections so you knew what you were reading about
in a way she is responsible for her future
the author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion
you should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample
diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside
a conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic b was the stretchiest plastic
she said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt
crash course and little bits but a big deal
however endocytosis is a form of active transport
paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website
the amount of vinegar needed is essential information
he concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk
next trna bring the correct anticodons to the mrna for the construction of the protein
a based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type b had the most stretchability
black black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors
after that in the the section afer the introduction the author tells how space junk has come about
two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment
following that the next catagory is crash course he talks about what could go wrong with satallites
when an invasive species is introduced to an environment it will complete to an indigenrous species food source
they live where they do because that is where they can survive
paul also learns that mr leonard couldnt read
pandas and koalas also are confined to one part of the world while pythons are now in many
mr leonard stays after school even longer to help paul
in closing the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem
although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure
they also could have done another trial for more accurate results
one way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure
lastly it should include the size of the container because it could have a different result
the student could improve the experiment by through if he tells us which amount of weight he used
he also had potentinal to be a star track athlete
a python in the everglades on was caught eating a alligator
a i think that the plastic type a was the strongest because it stretched down the least
a my conclusion is that plastic b was the most stretchable plastic
the author organizes the article into several sections the intro what is space junk
paul offters to train him and help him read
based on what three bases you have in each segment a trna will bring that corresponding amino acid
this is also a type of passive transportosmosis osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water
this show how he felt the need to return the help
their food source is only found in their home place so adapting to other places would be extremely hard
they should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width
paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school
i say that because he didnt want paul going through life feeling discouraged like mr leonard did
example the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar
then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged
the plastic type b had stretched the most
and finally they end the article with the little bits but a big deal section
now they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision
in little bits but a big deal the author elaborates on why we should be concerned
according to the results from the experiment the color black had the highest average air temperature of
and type c d were c tmm tmm d tmm tmm
then the sections following that get more in depth and portray the seriousness of orbiting junk
it teaches paul to overcome the tough obsicals in life as mr leonard almost did
where do the samples go to sit and dry at
then he found out that he had flunked out of college because he couldnt read
one could accurately determine which was the most stretchable
and plastic b stratched the most from all the plastics used
she does so many things to be accomplished that she doesnt care how stressed out she is
the background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects paul by giving him motivation
this is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color
paul could really relate his story to mr leonard because he as well couldnt read
paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer
lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with and how
cells also use passive and active transport
you would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container
light gray was in the mid dle of the data
i feel paul and mr leonard are closer because mr leonard told paul thoes secret things about him
what containers and what are we supposed to label
chinas panda and australias koala are similar because they are both special lists
rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school
otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment
since plastic a had the least stretched legnth it is the strongest or least plastic plastic
paul can relate to how mr leonard feels
you know that he surprised because he confronts him about it
little bits but a big deal this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the earth
the information both shocks him and connects paul with mr leonard
this is because it stretched the least throughout both trials
the weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results
the author organizes the article in a very logical way
the writer splits the most important facts into seperate paragraphs
he is familiar with the things that mr leonard had went through
active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave
by knowing this information i would be able to replicate the experiment
i would need to know how much vinegar i was pouring into every cup
how much of each sample is being poured into the container
lastly plastic a went from mm in t to mm in t
plastic type b was the most stretchiest plastic type a stretched the least
he emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space
they are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles
he realized that mr leonard had felt the same thing that he paul was feeling
this means that they can adapt very easily to new environments whereas specialists can not
then the author gives some information about how dangerous space junk can be
after school she goes to work then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner
i would also need to know what size the container should be that im pouring the solutions into
mr leonard sees a lot of himself in paul and that reminds him of how he used to be
the author also lists details of conflicts with satellites and crashes that have occured in the past
unlike pythons that eat a variety of animalsrather than a specific plant
i think that mr leonards background information has a big effect on paul
on the third step another trna brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather
secondly they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results
this means they consume lots of things that an ecosystem needs which makes said area less diverse
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
one trait that can describe rose is optimistic
this is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy
endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules such a food into the cell
she even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay
the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog
after the realization of mr leonards past paul wanted to help him
the article deals whether or not this is true of this case
just like mr leonard helped paul with his training for track
the author puts orbiting junk in to sections to show what is space junk
the article finishes with a conclusion that outlines space pollution and the issues that can arise because of it
they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar
the article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk
the student should haw used the same length plastic for each
also you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers
paul finds out that mr leonard could not read either
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialists
the author organizes the article in different titled sections
a vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane
the group needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials
paul had the same problem he couldnt read also
another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag
it also determines paul to do better in school and track
the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane
it could hold the most weight without stretching
panda bears eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples
they also conclude that the space junk is making space missions more dangerous
also he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew
also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into
for the way she trys to take care of her sister and does alot of work for the family
t hat is shown by the data in the deg c increase in temp
the last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal
these foreign predators are taking root because of humans and there condessness
a plastic a stretched the least of all pour other plastics
after leaving the nucleus the mrna travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome
the last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for
plastic type b is the most stretchable with an average of mm of stretchability
a based on the students data ive concluded that plastic b was the stretched plastic
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
mr leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read bc they didnt have help centers
then they go on by describing what space junk actually is
then he went into crasc course which is talking about craches that has happened over the years
the student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample
also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for
if they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment
specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use
and that the hall monitor grabowski couldnt read that good himself so they had something in common
paul was curious as to why mrleonard had never mentioned of his running past
paul finds out that mr leonard won the meter hurdles at nationals and broke records
the effect the background information had on paul was one of surprise
finding one with a tracker in the pythons stomach concludes that this reptile is invasive
the information that paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something
the effect that background information has on paul is that he has someone who can empathize with him
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers
without any of the background information none of this would have happened
when the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made
he pressed for the answer by asking well what happened after that
after reading the groups procedure i would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment
i also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container
pythons are generalists they can eat many things and so can live many places
diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell
also this procedure needs to include weigh the samples
stretching mm in the first trial and mm in the second trial
in the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest
in the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house
for both trials preformed type b stretched the furthest at mm mm
the third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers
it doesnt say if the samples were put in different locations
none of the other plastics had stretched as much
in the story paul gets background information on mr leonard
this quote shows china pandas and australias koala bears are similar because they mostly eat one thing
another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it
the word invasive can be looked at in two ways in the article
when paul learns about who mr leonard was that inspires paul
in paragraph it reveals anna didnt want to hurt her aunt kolabs feelings
do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials
having at least trials would have made this experiment more valid
leonard had won the meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records
cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane
black using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter
paul goes to the learning center twice a week to learn how to read
the valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials
ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator
both the pandas in china and the koalas in australia are very similar
a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type a stretched the least
both paul and mr leonard had reading disabilities
the article uses the section what is space juck
it said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics
one process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis
the last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing and is still a problem
he first gives some history on waht space junk is in the section what is space junk
the author starts off trying to lure the reader asking a question
the procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it
what is space junk explains to the readers about what kind of items are left behind in space
so over all he did really well oragnizing this article
but in their defining characteristics they are very similar
as he imrpoves in the hurdles he is asked to join the track team
white the white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside
secondly how much vinegar should be added to each sample
it surprises him because mr leonard never told him about how he was a college track star
paul understands how mr leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading
based on the students data plastic b stretches the most and plastic a is the most rigid
they could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use
another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial
second they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar
the url happened to be about mr leonards past
additional information would include what were the four different substances
if she otld the truth she would hurt her aunt
they should say what samples are being tested not just mass samples
aplastic type b had stretched more than plastic type a in trials and
it also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem
rose asks how anna feels she would not ask this unless she cares about her
in the first piece of the article what is space junk
in t it stretched mm and in t it stretched mm
the background information given allows paul to connect to mr leonard
one specific example is under the section titled what is space junk the author answers just that question
pandas and koalas are both specialists
should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment
the information inspires paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and mr leonard
also i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers
therefore plastic type b is the weakest
after paul and mr leonard talked about mr leonards college accomplishments paul thought of an idea
this is supported by rose asking anna whats wrong
this is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane
line so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash
most generalist species are invasive because they look for different places to live
crash course little bits but a bing deal
she feels like she has to be a role model for anna
the author then talks about satellites and how they can become dead and just float freely in space
the word invasive is significant because it separates those are reptile impatalian and was against it
she felt too young for so much responsibilityimagining how her brother must feel
this background information that paul gets helps him understand why mr leonard is helping him
then the author provides the reader with a specific example of how harmful and serious space junk can be
because paul discovers this he feels a drive
the students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment
at last he talked about tiny bits of space trash
the author organizees the article in an easy to understand way
the third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space
they also talked about there grandpa moving away and how its been hard on them both
there fore it is hard for them to live in any other and find or environmental
how do i find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
it also suprised him that mr leonard had never told him about his records
the student can conclude that plastic b stretches the most
it made the bond that paul and mr leonard shared stronger
another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used
the protein then goes and does its job in the body
he feels that he can relate to mr leonard
another one was to explain the different types of plastics were
no matter how small the space junk is it is dangerous
which is debrie from satelittes and tools
it gave paul hope that some day he would be able to read
for example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described
the effect it has on paul is to motivating
plastic type b streched the same length in t and t mm
they should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step
i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup
paul was surprized by the fact mrleonard cant read and that he was in college
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo
it has come to my conclusion that plastic letter b is the strongest
then mr leonard tells paul how he flunked out of college
it should say what each sample is in the procedures
the author starts off with getting your attention
one trait that rose possesses is being compasionate towards others
i would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the hours
he continues the article by describing how space junk got into space and what it is
pandas and koala bears both live in warm climates where the plants they eat grow
the panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves
such as earth wood limestone and plastic and how much of each to put in
paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards mr leonard
also i would need to know if i should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area
also i would need to know how much vinegar to put in
and what are the four different samples
one way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using
in the article it says that pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
paul decides to help mrleonard the same way that mr leonard helped him
they end the article with telling of the dangers of microdebris
his first actions are to inquire about his coachs former accomplishments
then the author describes what space junk is
however once introduced here they can survive and thrive in the southern us
the chinese panda and the australian koala are two specialist species
the author organizes this article in to sections
they differ from pythons because pythons are generalists
paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like mrleonard did
the student should have told how heavy the weights were
mr leonard said i looked good back then didnt i
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would have to know more information
they then go into a breif description of space flight
the author explains how the engines used to power spaceships are disintegrated
paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to mr leonard
then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger
the student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results
pandas koalas are similar because they are both specialist species
paul was undergoing the exact same thing that mr leonard was paul couldnt read
after mrna leaves the nuclues it goes to ribosomal rna
this happens continuously to make proteins
she wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesnt on the inside
an example is in paragraph rose didnt answer
this organization technique is common in information essays
shes wishes for alone time and free time but knows she has the duty of helping her family
this ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant
the fact that mr leonard also struggles academically helps paul to relate to him
you would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material for example plastic could
another is how much water to use when rinsing it
invasive in the the article means that any species controling the habitat endangering other animals is considered invasive
well i would need to know what the problem statement is
mr leonard didnt tell paul because he couldnt read and flunked out of college
seeing what happened to mr leonard helped paul fight through challenges
this statement suggests that rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it
the author organizes this article intofour smaller articles that all have an overlying topic that is space junk
when paul discovers that mr leaonard was a track star and that he could not read
paul is shocked when he finds out who mr leonard realy is
when rose is talking to anna she tells her that what her family is doing is necessary
this experiment will need more trials to see if the results are convincing
should the samples be placed in a beaker graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container
finally the last section tells us how we can care
you need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers
to this day as he is telling the story to paul he is still unable to read
what type of vinegar and what time you started
however on the other hand this experiment is nt closley applicable
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were
the author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space
in order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are
they are both different from pythons because pythons are invasive species
the author organizes the article into four different sections
he sees that he can not read just like mr leonard
he realizes that he is just like mr leonard because they both can not read
after reading the groups procedure a few things are missing
one of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion
the effect the background background information about mr leonard has on paul is he can empathsize with mr leonard
and finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water
also you would need to know the kind of vinegar
rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok
diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane
white if the dog house is white then it will be co oler
the procedure should include what samples they are testing
they break it into sections which allows the reading to get a better understaning
the different headings talk about some of the topics that have to do with space junk
the author organizes this article in a way that grabs your attention at the beginning
you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
once the mrna reaches a stop codon the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond
this shows that she cares about how other people feel
this group is lacking a control group in their procedure
they should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much
the one with the least stretchability was plastic type a
a plastic type b is the one that has the most length
in the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation
when rose is tired from working and helping her aunt she must then do her homework
also i would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment
also they both eat basically the same type of food bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
the cause for this is to have everything more organized
crash course talks about crashes of space junk and little bits but a big deal talks about microdebris
the first one is called what is space junk
the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color
then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section crash course
i would also need to know what kind of rocks were used
also they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers
and probably her aunt would tell her mom
then a while later paul has a conversation with him
finally the last step is the stop codon on the mrna
material just flow through the cells pores
so i would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter
america is being invaded and steps in stop it need to be taken
then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed
she does everything she needs to do to make her familys plan go smoothly
he also wanted to assist mr leonard in reading
the information that he finds out about mr leonard shocks paul
third you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment
the author organizes the article by headlines before talking about the article
the author organize the article by using subheading and a strong intro
by knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible
in the article it says a python swallowed an alligator
he finds out about mr leonard winning the meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college
since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors
crash course and little bits but a big deal
last you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold
it suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic
one thing is the amount of vinegar used
it gives paul away to see mr leonard as an equal
she shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her
it explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites
let done specify which suitably materials were used marble limestone wood and plastic
they pant uncontrollably when they are overheated and get very uncomfortable
there are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment
becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from mr leonards experience
mr leonard explained it to him and inspired paul to help him
paul decides to take mr leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read
then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data
the emotions in mr leanards words were all to familier to me
the author organizes the article into three sections
black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use
osmosis is similar to diffusion but occurs with water
crash course and little bits but a big deal
the data showas the plastic for stretching more in b
they couldve put the same amount or different amount
the way the procedure is written now we dont know if the amount of weight was used constant
white by painting the dog house white it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler
chinas pandas eat bamboo and koalas in australia eat eucalyptus leaves which are both plants
also they should do another trial and then average out the results
mr leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades
they both have big population in their countries and they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves
in order to replicate this experiment i would needed to know the different types of samores
an example of this is the panda eating nothing but bamboo
lastly it is important to know how much of each substance to use
without these main information points nobody could replicate this lab
how much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains
the students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control
it stretched mm in trial one and mm in trial
the author also splits the text up into paragraphs that have the same idea
a conclusion would be plastic type a is the lested stretched with tmm and tmm
one way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything
diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration
so paul was blessed to have someone like him to help
the second step should state how much vinegar is usedin step four how much vinegar is used
mr leonard wants paul to do his best and do better then he did
this includes the problem of satelights running into each other
plastic sample c seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted
this is a very good way for the author to present their information
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are born specialists
two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp
secondly trna brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair
the mrna leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome
rose is considerate of other peoples feelings
then it slowly goes into crash courses and how bad it effects our atmosphere
the author organizes this article using passages for different information
a conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length
white brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray
black i think black would be the best color for the doghouse
after this process all three rnas have created a protein
the author puts thihs information under a section called crash course
rose is caring and doesnt like to upset others
osmosis the process by which water is moved from a high leel of concentration to a low one
when she talks to anna she said we have our part to do to help paul finish college
i lost my scholarship and flunked out mr leonard stated
one more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers
the students should say in the experiment what samples are being used
so the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house
the author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose
each section gives information about what happens
then background information on space exploration and what space junk really is
the last thing is how to store the samples for hours
he was upset because he thought mr leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past
the narrator is surprised at the information
the procedure should include what the four different samples are
in the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us
lastly i feel that i would need to know what to measure the mass with
no college would take him after that because they didnt want a runner that couldnt read
so i n conclusion ive determined that dark gray is the most logical choice
now instead of two disabled satellites there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space
another problem is that they didnt mention how much vinegar should be used
also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid
they are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything
then hell get a good job anna and hell pay for our college
the author organizes the article but using sub titles and paragraphs
such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled crash course
was deg c controlled varible temp
the author incorporated alot of information into a very well written article
to replicate the experiment the students need to include more detail in their procedure
is conclusion plastic b stretched the most and plastic a stretched less
by contrast the python is a generalist
i think that this is a very organized article
the background information on mrleonard surprises paul
one trait that decribes rose would be caring
finally the author describes how tiny fragments can hurt
they did not specify how they determined the mass
in the story paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader
paul finds out that mr leonard has a reading disability
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
in order to replicate this i would need to know what samples they placed into the containers
two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one
how much vinegar to pour into the samples
also they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step
for black was deg while the average for white was deg
paul listens to mr leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well
i would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers
paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well
when mr leonard gives paul some background information on his life paul begins to relate to him
the author has organized this article by asking questions or stating a subtitle for the next paragraph to answer
since both of them couldnt read in school and wre both great runners
how the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory
the second section what is space junk
also she cares about her family because she doesnt want to let them down with writing her essay
the small little things that float around can damage entire space stations
the students can able more trials to their experiments
plastic type b has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics
black black will make the doghouse to hot
a python is different from this because they are generalist
one way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial
paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too
in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell
they stated four vinegar in each they did not tell us how much vinegar to use
in order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done
like in the second sentance of paragraph she said maybe her life would get easier
because when she is talking to her aunt she didnt want to tell the truth and hurt her feelings
in the introduction the author tries to hook the reader in about space junk
i feel that the background information that paul discovered about mr leonard gave paul motivation
this is very significant because this means their numbers can not be kept in check and they might overpopulate
also they could have had a trial to see the results came at the same
in trial it stretched to and in trial it reached mm
in order to replicate this experiment the groups procedure should include more specific information
he underwstands why mr leonard worked with him to do this
they would also need to know what containers they used
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
the effect that the background information that paul finds on mrleonard is shocking to paul
the author organize his artivle very well
mr leonard couldnt read either and he couldnt get very far in his life
plastic type b stretched the most out of all the plastics
b keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement
you would also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in
this makes it hard for the m to survive anywhere else
first we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment
there should be a control included within the experiment
they could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount
the author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about
a conclusion based on the students data would be that plasic d has the most stretchability
that made paul want to study harder than before
but yes i am shure that paul was very suprised once he looked up the website
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia by how they really just eat one type of food
also paul got some motivations for himself by the story of mr leonard
paul is very shocked by what he sees on the internet about mr leonard
the article states that both animals eat a certain food present only in their native environment
youd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs
they both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read
paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete
each section is seperate different subjects
pandas and koalas have a limited area they can live
i believe they are both different because pandas and koalas are harbivors and pythons are carnivors
then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk
constant keep the results of experiment valid
space junk is pieces of debris from various space crafts and such
there are many traits that describe rose
he first talks about space junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space
since he flunked out of college nobody wanted a runner that couldnt read
in the third section titled crash course the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse
so painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint
there is no control in the starting length of the plastics
rose is very considerate of her family when talking to aunt kolab
they also should of told us what type of plastic they were using
paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star
unlike the python who is a generalist who can live anywhere because food is abundant
how much vinegar should go into each container
the python is a generalist species meaning that they have a larger range of adaptation
pauls natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting mr leonard about the startling information he discovered online
paul finds reading hard so does mr leonard
then how she has to work to help support her entire family
i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup
also i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor what is the temperature
how do you measure the ending mass of each sample
could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
first the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification
also the trial should be performed more than times
it also informs readers of how scientists are trying to overcome the issue of space junk
paul feels for mr leonard and he sympathizes for him
plastic type a stretched the least with mm on t and mm on t
mr leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read
she really shows this when she talks to anna about paul going to college
the way the author organizes this article is that he uses a very eye cathing thesis or opening statements
the group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container how much is needed
also what is the size of the containers
then the trna brings over the amino acid that matches the codon
i know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same
and finally i need to know if it is weighed in grams pounds or any other measurement
you would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use
when he confronted mr leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce
after listening to mr leonard explain his past
in order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information
therefore paul decides to help mr leonard begin to start reading
the author organizes his article by putting a title over each section
also what temperature they were in and what i am lableing the containers
the author organizes his article by starting with an introduction which he uses to pull the reader in
then there is another titled little bits but a big deal
in the third paragraph the reader talks about the risk of space junk
so not too much thermal energy but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best
black the color black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse
although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure
the student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat
then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be
also list the type of meteral they roused
the author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention
however snakes are becoming overly popular
dark gray the best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray
the author seperates this article into sections
he broke the college freshman record for the meter hurdles
also they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate
the first paragraph is a very good attention getter it makes it clear to grab your attention
you would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers
the author organizes this article into sections with titles with an opening paragraph to grab the readers attention
then in each section the author gives details about the topic of the section given away in the titles
after mrna leaves the nucleus it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome
a trait that can desciribe rose would be that she is very sincere
he wants to try to do something for himself because of the affect mr leonard had an on him
i concluded that plastic type b was the most stretchable
the first section describes what space junk is and what happens to it
she is also very appreciative in this example
he then wants to coach mr leonard in reading like mr leonard coached him in track
paul now understood that he could overcome his problems to and become a hurdler like mr leonard
the author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover
it would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into
the second is called what is space junk
you would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the hours sitting
plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least
in order to replicate this experiment additional information is needed
the final section talks about the power of space junk falling from the atmosphere
the next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the earth
one way the validity of the results could have done more trials
when paul first discovers the shocking new information on mr leonard he is a bit confused
however these students need to improve their experimental design
therefore they can live in many areas and are called generalists
they would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve
the author has three sections in his article
when he did he found out that mr leonard couldnt read
rose is willing to work for her family because that is tradition that occurs in cambodia
next is the evidence of the danger sapce junk can make in crash course
paul learns that mr leonard was a track star in college which seems to inspire him
the procedure left out some information that is needed
this would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog
thats why in brandi and jerrys lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors
you would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add
the ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops
paul responds by feeling more of a connection to mr leonard
the author organized the article in an explaining order
the author then describes in great detail what exactly space junk is and what is made up of
pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists
the need to have all the materials and put it in order
he then goes on to explain what space junk is
when paul recieved the background information on mr leonard he saw a connection between them
in order to replicate this experiment you would need corr
they could have improved validity by adding another trial
what type of container how much vinager
the last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations
generalists favor change unlike the specialist
it is important to have them all be the same size
also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching
the group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control
in order to effectively replicate this experiment
paul now understood more things about his coach
paul learns that mr leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship
i need to know what the four different samples are
the student couldve as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm
they are different from pythons because they move to a new environment and adapt as well
you would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment
also i would need to know where i should place a sample
in paragraph it shows rose thinking of others before herself
he learns that mr leonard is the same as him
otherwise we couldnt even start the experiment
they did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container
the second section is titled what is space junk
the track coach and paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great
how pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat one thing nothing but it
they could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment
but he also didn know that leonard didn no how to read
lastly he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that nasa is looking for a solution
the word invasive is crutial to understand the article
ain conclusion it is clear that plastic type a stretched the least over the five minutes
i would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found
in the trials the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as
the author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences
paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them
a i came to the conclusion that plastic type b had the most stretchability out of all plastics
i order of the stretchiest would be b d c and a
they then move on to overviewing what space junk consists of and how it came to be
the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by
to repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container
under the subtitle crash course the author tells about a collision that happend
but when talking to her aunt she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go
osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane
i would also need to know the problem to this experiment
i feel that it opeed pauls eyes and made him think if himslf
paul find out that mrleonard was a track star but he flunked out because he made bad grades
this gives paul hope that he can be good at something too
the data shows that in both trials t and t plastic b stretched and
crash course and little bits but a big deal
the first section tells us about the space invasion and about general space junk
one process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis
you can not obtain consistancy a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment in only two trials
so inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
in step i would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container
she doesnt want to hurt others so she watchs what she says and is respectful
the author organizes the article by using catchy phrases and useful information to better understand the subject
rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family
one trait that describes rose is understanding
you would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples
lastly he or she talks about small issues that are a big deal
pandas can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptis
once the trna reaches the stop codon the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed
they organize the article into sections that are important and give explanation
the procedure should contain what different samples are going to weighed
in her conversation with anna rose sees that her younger sister is upset
white white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot
this section defines what his main idea is about and gives the reader a better understanding about his topic
the second most strechy polimer was plastic d i remained at mm both trials
in the data plastic type b stretched to mm on t and mm in t
it is very clear that plastic type b has the most stretchability and type a has the least
rose feels as if she is being overwhelmed with everything she has to do
it would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers
leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes
he puts things down by there importance uses tone of voice and organizes his thoughts well
that may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab
so he began teaching mr leonard how to read
the author first gives the reader background information on the problem
to know that all the plastics were the same length
rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people
the truth was that rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family
in his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines and
he then explains in crash course what happens
these carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy
paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with mr leonard about reading difficulties
yet both of these animals are extremly different from a python
pandas koalas both have specialized diets
when rose is talking to her younger sister anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay
they also say to let it sit for hours where should it sit
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
this leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that dead satellites cause and so on
also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples
only some substances can leave and only some may enter
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
pandas only eat bamboo and koalas bears feed to only eat leaves he stated in paragraph
one thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container
the author organizes the article by headlines
paul learned that mr leonard was a great track runner in college
invasive species are nonnative species that are introduced to an environment and will eat indigenous species
i would also need to know what temperature
mr leonard ran meter hurdles at nationals mr leonard even broke records
they move on to what really is space junk
after that the auther explains hoe space junk occurs in crash course
you would need to know how big of cups to use
allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence
to the different samples were listed in the procedure it would be betterunderstand
then the article goes on to say that space junk is becoming a problem
paul is inspired by the fact that mr leonard a great athlete is training him
plastic type d stretched mm both times
will we completely submerge it or only partially
additional information i would need to know would include several things
the author organizes the article by different topics
in the first bullet the four samples should be stated as marble limestone wood and plastic
the author organizes the article by putting specific ideas together
the temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment
this makes them different from the python because the python eats a wide range of thins
he then moves on to inform you of the main problem of space junk with his primary thesis
the word invasive when the tain approving bear in the article
the amino acids form an amino acid chain which is also called a protein
he says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
and he knew thats mrleonard was trying to make him succeed unlike he did
overall the article was assembled in a simple way that made it easy to understand for any reader
paul didnt understand how he got to college
they also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable
it is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used
osmosis moves water down the cell membrane
he couldnt believe that he broke records in the meter hurdles in college
they then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is
paul shows this by saying cmon mr leonard
the student could have done more trials
also i dont know how much vinegar to pore in each cup
in the procedure the first step is measuring the length but i dont see that data
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
you would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry
rose doesnt want to hurt anyones feelings
also type d is the most accurate because mm was reached in both trials
just like mr leonard did by helping him get on the track team
pandas consume bamboo which grows naturally only in china
some other information i would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red
example the average heat was for the white and for the black
to repeat this lab i would need to know what kind of vinegar they used
paul complies and meets mr leonard in the gym where a basketball team is playing
in the everglades in a very rare case a python attempted to eat a alligator and exploded
it had given him the chance to excel at something like never before
you would also need to know how they determined the mass
and also have started out with the same length for every plastic
the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse
another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis
one section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is
he starts out telling what space junk is
the amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well
then the author describes what the kinds of junk are found in space from these previous space missions
he flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for
in order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information
paul is willing to hepl mrleonaard with his problem
the background information that paul recieves connects with him
rose doesnt want to move to cambodia and her aunt understands that
but mr leonard was more then just a hall monitor
the background information had a major effect on paul
he or she then tells you what space junk is
the author starts with the simple question what is space junk
it made paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well
black black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm
at the end paul decides to teach mr leonard how to read
i would also need to know what type of container
this is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color
the author goes on to give background information about the space program
the information made paul want to become a better athlete and reader
indicate what miterials you are finding the mass of
mr leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read
next another trna connects to the next codon bringing in another amino acid
paul is amazed at mr leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner
then the author tells how the space junk actually gets where it is
as she attempts to get out water fills her mouth and she sinks further down
however the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of degc
according to the text a python swallowed an alligator
plastic type a is the best because it can stretch the most
here they explain that when satellites malfunction they become hightech junk
first he has the introduction part of the article
when paul found out that mr leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery
rose is giving anna the hope of going to college and having a successful life
shes not only worried about herself but paul also
when he told mr leonard about the url he reccived mr leonard told paul about his past
they could have had a constant beginning plastic length
the student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial
the trna carries anticodons to the condons on the mrna
mr leonards background information had a large effect on paul
paul finds out that mr leonard was a college track star that broke many records
another is what kind of containers do they want us using
keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment
this information also helps paul realize that mr leonard and him share a connection
also by letting the plastics hang for minutes but also minutes
the student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp
the author talks about satellite crashes and the results of them in the second section
the information gives paul motivation to never give up on school or athletics
now paul wants to keep running and help mr leonard learn to read
white this color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors
one piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers
he does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk
this show pauls intent on finding out why mr leonard did not move onto bigger and better things
the next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes
the author uses subtitles to organize the article
translation takes place in the cytoplasm
the word invase describes how pythons are becoming an invasive species
passive transport also moves substances out of the membrane but it does not require energy
paul knows exactly what mr leonard went through because he is going through the same thing
another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights
plastic type b has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about mm
different environments could affect the date
this debris is very troublesome because spacecrafts get damaged by this debris and it becomes very dangerous
he gives you the background or history of space junk
one trait rose has is that she can make the best out of anything
b one way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control
he is surprised by the janitors previous experiences
even though paul was good at jumping hurdles he felt as though he wasnt good enough
through osmosis water can freely pass through the membrane
cells use selective permiability to control substance movement
by performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate
another is where should the samples sit in sun or indoors this may have an affect
the author organizes this article by first introducing the topic then explaning what the topic really is
this would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer
in the first trial it stretched mm and in the second trial it stretched mm
mr leonard said that he could not read either
each section provides important statistics on the topic
the student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length
he begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader
what temperature was the room at to make it dry
the conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type b stretched the most
the background information has a positive effect on paul because it reminds him of himself
according to the data plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic
then he explains what makes the space junk
this motivates paul to work hard during school and on the track
the student couldve conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were
the student should have conducted at least more trial to validate the experiment since trials are necessary
this makes paul appreciate his tutoring
mr leonard and paul are both good at hurddles
also they couldve repeated the experiment by daily one more trial
paul also is a little confused on how mr leonard didnt make it as a runner
so paul decides to teach his teacher how to read once and for all
by paul learning of mr leonards past he feels more accepted and normal
how long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights
with a little training we can do whatever
white painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house
the students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same
has all the information about how space junk has gotten into our atmosphere and what it is
the author organizes the article in sections
the author organized the article using topic headlines
they are both different from the pythons because they are not even close to the some spices
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist
osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane
for example in paragraph nineteen it says rose didnt answer
the group also need to specify what the samples are
rose didnt want to hurt aunt kolab or make her feel bad
i know that plastic type b is the most it stretchable of the four plastics type i tested
it wouldnt make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is
in the story gifts paul finds out information about mr leonard that he never told him
in conclusion plastic type b has the most stretchability
i would need to know the original size of each of the four different samples
another way is add control to the experiment
fir example the burmese python is threatening fire endangered species in the filmla keys
he now knows him and mr leonard are more alike than what he thought
in paragraph paul mentions that mr leonard went to colleage
this process is repeated until a stop code is reached
not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled
this person also starts out by asking a question and then going into what is space junk
it also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris its any object
for example skin snow says that the snakes are unwanted and are eating endangered species
another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic
in order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what different samples to use
well the strongest effect that website about mr leonard had on paul was shock and suprise
it show when she does not answer her aunt to keep from hurting her aunts feelings
nonative animals invade a land and sort of offset the balance of nuture in that area
therefore the students should specify the marble limestone wood plastic
they could also use more precise instrument or run more trials
the author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat
passive transport does not require energy but active transport does
the author organizes the article by having an interesting introduction that catches the readers attention
paul is a younger version of mr leonard when he was a high school student
paul realizes this and connects them with a bond
in crash course the author is talking about the dangers of satellites colliding with each other
this is what effects paul and he would learn from mrleonard mistakes and become a better reader
i t hought it might be too hot for the dog
this give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on
when paul learns that mr leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
to improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data
each section has a header indentifying it
last i would need to know where to keep the containers during the hours
if th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties
she is hoping and trusting that paul will do well in college
paul was given informattion about mr leonard from when he was younger
he takes mr leonard to the school for some training in reading
after that in the section titled crash course the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted
one thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups
mr leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college
i would need to know what the samples were
he continues to ask well what happened after that
i would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples
a plastic type b was the most stretchable while plastic type a was the least
chinas panda eats almost nothing but bamboo
in the conversation rose was having with anna she was trying to reassure her sister
the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article
then the article has seperate subtopics which state important details relating to the subtopic
the movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient
those who support this statement would consider the python invasive
that is why i think paul was both shocked and confused
first you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container
white i would choose to paint the dog house white
one section talks about and describes what is space junk
under crash course the author explains how sattelites colide into eachother
the australia koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
after paul learns of mr leonards past he is curious and surprised
he then explores the topic in more detail using three different sections
their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch
in the article it said that a python went into the everglades and swallowed an alligator
she says this to try to comfort her sister who is upset about papa leaving
when he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes
these pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results
this process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy
in the lamp expirement it was the nd coolest color
pandas in china only eat bamboo koalas in australia only eat eucalyptus leaves
this would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results
white white would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer
then comes the conclusion that gives the authors opinion on the topic of the space junk crisis
the author organizes this article into four main parts orbiting junk what is space junk
after paul got a background check on mr leonard it had really touched him
one trait is that rose is optimistic she looks at things positively
so the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals
the experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat so it will keep the doghouse cooler
every week mr leonard asked the same question where are you going
then he ends it by talking about how it can affect us
pandas from china and koalas in australia are both similar because they both eat plants
her aunt then begins to question her about if she feels weighted down
when paul confronts him he finds out mr leonard cant read like himself
in a lot of ways she has the leadership trait
the student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched
it also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided
cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane
rose is help ful because she help around the house and help paul finish college
the have differently adapting to all other habitats but their own
they have a common problem with reading
a base on the data given plastic b stickched for nest
this is just one example of how rose is a kind and caring person
one way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test
rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relatives feelings
rose immediately took in her sisters body language and asked her what was wrong
lastly i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment
you also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it
paul also finds out that mr leonard flunkred out of college simply because he couldnt read
the weight was and how many clamps to use
also by using the same weight to weights
the author uses an attentiongetter at the beggining of the article to draw readers in
this allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped
facilitated diffusion energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration
this type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy
he asked questions about it and seemed very interested
this allowed paul to see that him and mr leonard were similar
paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received
the symapthy that paul feels for mr leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills
this way the averages would be closer to what they should be
the background information about mr leanard suprises paul
this introduction makes people want to read on
she believes that when you help someone they will help you in return
the group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be
if when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree
like paul mr leonard was poor in school
facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances
they need these specific things to survive
two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist
both these animals are different from pythons
a the plastic type b has the greatest stretchability out of the other types
just like the pandas koalas eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves
paul now understands why mr leonard did not know his name
they are both different from pythons because pythons eat many of things
rose is caring and wants to help people
step cut a omm strip of each plastic
paul now understands why mrleonard wanted to help paul be on the track team
two how much of each sample is added to each cup
the students could have conducted more trials which could have improved the experimental design and validity
animals have been divided into two sections specialists and generalists
i believe that two obvious traits that rose possesses is hope and courage
the author than staes an instance where space junsk acused an accident
this makes them similar but different from pythons because pythons eat other animals unlike koalas pandas
the movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration
cells use osmosis to either gain or get rid of water by passing it across the cell membrane
a from this data one can conclude that plastic type b stretched the most in both trials
i believe it makes paul realize what kind of person mr leonard is
the effect that background information paul has about mr leonard is astonishes paul greatly
also around how much of the samples do you need
he felt sympathetic for mr leonard because he couldnt read like him
one thing you would need to know is what use of containers you need
these species brought over are taking place of our own animals
in addition one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample
finally she challenges the readers integrity by asking about the seriousness of this to other people
the effect on paul about discovering the background information on mr leonard is empathy
another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched
also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers
that she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person
in other words pandas and koalas are not something to really worry about unlike pythons
these two animals require certain factors in their habitat
one way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant
this shows that unlike pandas and koalas pythons can adapt to other environments
protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this
i would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph
bamboo and eucalyptus leaves are both plants
before he didnt realize how much not being able to read could effect your future
the average of black is a high a t degrees
she is a compasionate and caring person that cares about others
the reason that the emotions are familiar to paul is because paul feels those exact emotions almost every day
he can not read and struggles with his homework
for example in the introduction grab your telescope
once he finds this out he wonders why mr leonard did not tell him about his past
paul has the same feelings and relates to mr lenoard
in paragraph paul relates to mr leonards life
there are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
the backround information effected paul because they both had things in common
when paul found out about mr leonards background it was all to familiar to paul
im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do
the author uses the introduction to grab the readers attention
therefore this article is neatly organized in different sections
also they should have established a starting length of the plastic
such as the titles what is space junk
beaker test tube a regular container
paul understands mr leonard and since mr leonard helped him he is going to help mr leonard
also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds
he also tells us how an asronaut lost his tool bag in space
an probably her aunt would tell her mother
they also could have used the same length of different plastics each time
they could have also repeated the trials
i would need to know what to label the containers
if she tod the truth she would hurt her aunt
passive transport is high to low concentration and active transport is low to high concentration
spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology
