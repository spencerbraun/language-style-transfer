And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control .
^p b . )
One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis .
They had something in common .
After that , the auther explains hoe space junk occurs in 'Crash Course . '
For example , the headers 'What Is Space Junk ? '
It 's a .
So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track .
Plastic B , proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics .
Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment .
In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size .
white : : White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer .
These help to move different things across a cell .
Paragraph 46 says , ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , I said , walking back toward the school .
It turns out Mr. Leonard was n't a good reader either , and flunked out of college .
This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use .
He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him . '
Finally , all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier .
Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present .
Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person .
They are both different from the pythons because they are not even close to the some spices .
'what 's wrong ?
Paul realizes this and connects them with a bond .
Its a comet !
The codon and anticodon bind , and form an amino acid .
The first section is just the opening that catches one 's attention .
Therefore , the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house .
Paul also sees this as a way to help Mr. Leonard just like he had helped him .
The author organizes the article into three sections , following the introduction .
They eat things that take them linger to swallow and break it down than koala & panda bears .
^p b .
Pythons can eat , really anything and live anywhere making survival easy .
Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college .
This is the effect which Mr. Leonard 's background information had on Paul .
Specialist specie favor stability .
Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab .
Three types of movement that cells use to move substances acrossed the membrane are , one is osomis .
Based on the data , plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics .
What the out come is .
a .
Pandas are specialist , meaning they dine on bamboo .
They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track .
It does n't say if the samples were put in different locations .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' helps to create a debate in the article .
The word invaisive is significant to this article .
Passive transport requires no energy .
In 'What Is Space Junk ' , the author tells us what space junk is .
Rose is a young girl in her late teenage years .
When Rose is talking to Anna , she tells her that what her family is doing is necessary .
Another information
Anna cares about other people , even when it causes stress for her .
Paul is implying he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Pythons would try to eat other animals , that what makes them different . ''
Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in .
After the mRNA leave the nucleus , there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis .
She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab .
Third , you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use .
The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use .
is clearly going to talk about what space junk is .
This is where Rose shows her maturity .
Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial .
Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic .
She very worried for the family and that is why she says 'What 's wrong ?
The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read .
I need to know what the four different samples are .
During the story , the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
It would n't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is .
How much of such sample should be used .
.
Rose immediately took in her sister 's body language and asked her what was wrong .
Well Paul dose not know how to read that good .
Al so , white looks much better on houses than black , dark grey , or light gre y .
Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well could n't read .
One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
^p They should have had a control , atrial where no weights were added .
The panda mainly eats bamboo as the Koala maily eat eucalyptus leaves .
White does attract heat like the color black does .
When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked .
Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was young .
Active Transport : Used to move substances by way of transport protien against the concentration gradient .
In the last paragraph , paul wants Mr. Leonard to start training .
At the part of the story when Mr. Leonard states 'We had no learning centers in our school . '
These sections describe what 'space junk ' is .
Paul was shock to find out the Mr.Leonard broke records back in his college years .
It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard did n't seem happy about seeing the printout .
'It 's time to start your training . ' .
Things were different back then .
`` A ) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least .
Really , though , they are just animals trying to survive .
One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size .
Based on the student 's data .
They are native species unlike the generalist python which is considered to be an invasive species by many .
Rose never loses hope .
The author also lists details of conflicts with satellites , and crashes that have occured in the past .
Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used .
Paul is amazed .
For example , he puts information about space junk in 'What Is Space Junk ' .
Every week , Paul passes Mr. Leonard , a hall monitor , on his way to remediation .
Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him .
Species that do five things are called invasive . ''
The author organizes the article from most important to the least important .
I w ould paint the doghouse white .
Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace .
Look up in the sky !
There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment .
^p + Temperature affects evaporation .
Also what siz container .
Rose could be considered protective towards her family .
This signals the end of protein synthesis .
In 'Gifts ' Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard .
This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point .
Pandas in China are both similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
The author organizes the article by different concerns .
Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat .
For example , Skin Snow says that the snakes are unwanted and are eating endangered species .
There is the introduction , followed by the three subtitles : 'What Is Space Junk ?
In order to replicate this experiment .
The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA .
They used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk .
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a runner also he is very surprised .
Two ; They could have had more than 2 trials .
Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer .
That also could effect the difference of the mass 's .
They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners .
the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color .
Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3 .
How Space junk is formed and what happens to the debris in space .
Plastic B stretched the most .
However , the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C
The author organized the article in an explaining order .
So 25 to make the experiment uniform .
He plans out the paper very well .
B ) One way the student 's could 've improved their design is by adding a third trial .
Then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel .
Pythons on the other hand are generalists , and can adapt to change easily .
What kind of `` '' sample of material '' '' are you using .
Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also could n't read .
^p B .
Also repeat twice .
He is unable to read but is a good at running track .
Just like with the jar l id when it was black , it absorbed the most .
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome .
He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard .
Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest .
In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm .
What are the four different samples ?
There is a disagreement between the pandas and the biologists .
Finally , the last section tells us how we can care .
Since they do n't press danger to people they are similar and also different from pythons .
The author organizes this article because each section provides different details to different aspects of spance junk .
The author grabs your attention in the introduction .
So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it .
In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest .
Also to say how much weight to the clamp .
Also , a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length .
After the introduction , the author adds some the history involved with satellites and space junk .
These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment .
One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport .
Then Mr.Leonard explains everything .
white : : painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors .
The first section describes what space junk is , and what happens to it .
And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers .
The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added .
Also , pythons can sometimes be kept as pets .
It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles .
Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability .
A ) In conclusion , my hypothesis was right .
As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic .
The just use thing they know and but things where they belong .
the author expalins what the 'junk ' is that is orbiting .
I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother .
They should have been more specific about their mass ( g ) of the weights used .
a .
As long as a python is hungry enough it will clearly resort to any food source .
There are two types of transport : active and passive .
making plastic b have the most stretchability .
Lastly , I would want to know the acidity of the acid ( aka ) vinegar .
The mRNA lands on the rRNA and waits for the tRNA to bring amino acids .
Pual felt some sort of empathy because he knows what it 's like not being able to read well .
He had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before .
An invasive species is a non-native species that is introduced into an environment .
Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis .
Osmosis : Moving water across the membrane by way of carrier protiens .
white : : White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala are similar because they are both special lists .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
He also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel .
He does this first by talking about the 'Orbiting Junk ' and then by 'What is space Junk ? '
Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers .
Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse .
The section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
a ) Based on the students data I 've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic .
First the writer grabs your attention with the introduction .
Secondly , tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome .
Eventually , Paul was able to join the track team .
ONE TRAIT TO DESCRIBE ROSE IS CARING .
Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read .
Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane .
The group 's procedure is missing a couple of elements .
I would say Rose is an understanding person .
The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm .
First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab .
The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful .
In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm .
Two , you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container .
^p B ) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed .
Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star .
There invasive species do n't chose to invade , but day which threatens habitats everywhere .
The author organizes the article into three specific sections , 'What is space junk ?
The author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they 're both specialists .
The background information about Mr. Leonard has an astronomical effect on Paul .
The author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them .
The author organize the article by opening it with a brief introduction about 'space junk ' .
Pandas & koalas are similar because they are both specialist species .
This process occurs by diffusion .
Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track .
^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials .
Also in the 4th step , it says , to rinse each sample with distilled water .
The author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous .
Finally , they state why 'space junk ' is such a problem .
According to the article , pandas & Koalas are specialists who differ from pythons who are generalists .
Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used .
He knew them well .
'No other school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
it makes Paul feel like he can accomplish what Mr. Leonard never had the opportunity to .
Finally , He talks about the importance of keeping space clean .
Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna .
a .
She loves her sister very much and you can see that by what questions she asked Anna .
This person organizes it by having head lines in bold letters .
The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites .
The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one .
After Paul learned all of this information , he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard .
So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another .
Lastly , I would also put in my procedure , how much amount of vinegar they are putting in .
My conclusion is that type B stretched the most .
The author organizes the article by having an interesting introduction that catches the reader 's attention .
the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog .
Diffrent sections depending on what the paragaph was about .
^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at .
Paul says 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
Osmosis is similar to diffusion , but occurs with water .
This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab , she has all these thing to do .
After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past .
Instead it floats around in space .
THen going on to say how big of a deal the 'junk ' is .
One trait that we can see in Rose is that she does n't like to hurt people .
She is also very appreciative in this example .
This way the averages would be closer to what they should be .
The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein .
Look up in the sky !
The author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other .
That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
If she did n't she would have ignored Anna and got on her paper .
Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps .
'Crash Course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves .
Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard 's emotions because he too , had difficulties wtih school work .
In this experiment students tested to see
The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh .
You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers .
A panda in China and koala from Australia are both similar because they mainly eat one food .
The procedure should also encourage repetition .
Cells can use Active Transports , which is where there is energy used .
Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard .
The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container .
Pythons however can adapt and find food , and are therefore generalists .
You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with .
Lastly , the article explains what is being done about this problem .
I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers .
Then the sections following that get more in depth and portray the seriousness of orbiting junk .
It says `` '' identical '' '' , but does not specify anything else .
Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g .
^p b .
The Third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane .
The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by ; 1 .
^p 3 ) And they should make sure they have the same size of each material .
Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul .
Then , he went into Crasc Course which is talking about craches that has happened over the years .
Also , the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored .
white : : White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot .
One trait of Rose is that she is caring .
The size of the container needs to be determined .
Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial .
Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too .
white : : white reflect the light .
Lastly , he/she explains why it is a big deal to many people why space junk is dangerous .
And also have started out with the same length for every plastic .
A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not there is a control in the experiment .
First , you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container .
The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers .
This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors .
I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy .
And this reminded Paul of himself and pushed him to work harder for him .
This causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space .
They could have said how long the plastic was when they started .
it stretched 12mm without breaking .
The third is to record the information obtained .
Neither of them change their diet which , for koalas is eucalyptus leaves , and for pandas , bamboo .
The author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily , without much confusion .
In order to replicate the experiment , we would need to know what different samples to use .
If the sizes vary , the data found is useless .
In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family .
A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all to familiar to me .
^p B .
Paragraph 19- Rose did n't answer .
The panda and koalas eat resources people need .
The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
' , 'Crash Cource ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial .
Then after they tell you about that , they tell you how unsafe little bits are .
They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles .
Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar .
If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached .
At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage .
They also do best when around humans .
white : : Darker colors usually attract more light .
In the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo .
He never expected that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
'Hey my friend , where do you think your going ? '
Another way to give a hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong .
3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds .
Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2 .
This paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space .
One thing the student could 've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size .
They also did n't mention the measure the plastic be originally .
Plastic type B stretches the most ( 22.5 ) .
A conclusion based on the student 's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability .
The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic .
But pandas and koalas can only live in china and australia due to the plants they eat .
So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too .
Paul probably did n't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard .
Meanwhile pythons have a variety of things to eat from .
white : : Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint .
This section informs the reader that space junk is a serious problem that needs to be addressed .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
Talking about the first launch and the space race in the Cold War .
The risks and dangers are further explained in , 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar .
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning .
And finally , they end the article with the 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' section .
The author first gives the reader background information on the problem .
It helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read .
Marble , limestone , wood , and plastic .
I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container .
' I lost my scholarship and flunked out .
The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk , then providing the dangers of it .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college .
according to the experiment , us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low .
He asks Mr. Leonard what happened and he acts concerned about it .
Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic .
Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects .
Paul asks why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him when he was coaching Paul .
Next , he explains to us just exactly what space junk is and how it gets there .
the temperatre was 42 ( DEG ) and the hight was the black at 53 ( DEG ) .
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a staggering effect on Paul .
Under the subtitle 'Crash Course ' the author tells about a collision that happend .
The mRNA enters the ribosome .
Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic .
It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space .
Active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat .
I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic .
In order to replicate the groups experiment , I would need a lot of additional information .
These substances move from high concentration to low concentration .
The author organizes the article by using the classic topical structure .
She is so worried about helping her brother go to college .
Paragraph 45 states , 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
The background information that Paul recieves connects with him .
He starts out with an intro and mentions 'space junk ' .
black : : Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors .
Populations , they are invasive .
Rose said as gently as she could .
He also believes that mankind chose to do what it wants so the species aren 4 invasive .
This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable .
A panda and a koala are both vegetarians .
One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container .
A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid .
Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college .
When Rose 's Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down , Rose did not answer .
To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
He then sets a historical background and defines the term 'space junk . '
Also , Paul can sympatize with Mr. Leonard , which will make their relationship stronger .
was 48 ( DEG ) C , for light gray it wa s 45 ( DEG ) C ave .
a .
You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors .
According to the article , pythons are endangering five species in the Florida in US .
The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard motivates him in two ways .
Also , they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same .
A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this .
Pythons will eat many things while pandas and koalas eat only one type of things .
While Paul is gon na help Mr. Leonard read .
Pandas can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptis .
Suddenly I realized what I could for him . '
Also other info would be , what size containers do you need for this experiment .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container .
a .
The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested .
What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership .
Paul said , 'Why ? '
so inside this doghouse when black , it can get hot .
One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety .
I would also need to know what size the container should be that I 'm pouring the solutions into .
Thus piece of info is crucial . ''
Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in .
The color white dos n't absorb as much heat as the other colors do .
`` Invasive has a negative connotation .
Also what would those 4 materials be .
Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received .
That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path .
The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help .
She decides to tell her aunt of this dream .
Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school .
Paul find out that Mr. Leonard was a good track runner , but not so good at reading .
In conclusion , some of the plastics stretched more than others , however all of them did stretch .
You would need to know what the four different samples are .
They also never listed the materials that needed to be used . ''
He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records .
So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color .
osmosis , which lets water in and out of the cell .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections .
This tells us pandas ca n't adapt to other places like pythons . ''
It 's time to start your training . '
Also , plastic type A is the least flexible .
The snakes are unwelcome unless kept in captivity . ''
In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well .
Which is debrie from satelittes and tools .
Look up in the sky !
To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container .
When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him .
Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial .
These species brought over are taking place of our own animals .
^p should they be relatively the same size ?
Type D stretched 20 ( mm ) on the first trial and the same amount on the second .
According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest .
Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity .
The student 's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching .
And while helping him , it would also improve Paul 's reading skills .
By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better .
The author begins with 'Orbiting Junk ' to describe the clutter of 'space junk ' in our orbit .
The plasma membrane is semi-permiable .
With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment .
Each plastic should be the same length .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers .
'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals.You broke records . '
When he did , he found out that Mr. Leonard could n't read .
The author organizes this article in a text book form .
Strong .
They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read .
Paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read .
) Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
white : : the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside .
Pandas and koalas have very specific habitats and life cycle .
Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar .
Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do .
As shown in paragraph 15 .
At the ribosomes tRNA attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mRNA .
They invaded the area and altered the natural balance of it .
They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read .
^p 1 ) Do it again .
Facilitated diffusion is diffusion only with large molecules .
The author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained .
One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers .
The author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading .
Without a control , we do n't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason .
black : : We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat .
China 's Panda is similar to Australia 's Koala because they both only live on one main food .
The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar .
The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm .
And in `` '' Air Temperature '' '' the average temp .
( tongs )
^p B . )
This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more .
Paul did n't understand how he got to college .
You would need a sample of each of the substances .
Because maybe the put or did different procesure .
The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same .
Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in .
Like in the article ' what is space junk ? '
One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything .
Active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient.2 .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein .
One trait that Rose is hopeful .
It attaches at the first bonding site which matches the complementary codons .
One major type of cellular movement is passive transport .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist .
The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A .
The background information has a positive effect on Paul because it reminds him of himself .
They both very little and they do n't eat meat .
^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers .
how should i determine the mass of the different samples ?
rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4 .
The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him of working harder .
After realizing Mr. Leonard 's story , Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him .
mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis .
validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2 .
Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class .
These cloumns include 'What is Space Junk ?
Next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another .
When he found out about this information , he was very empethetic .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested .
A python though does n't need as specific of living arrangnents besides a warm climate .
What is Space Junk ? , Crash Course , ect .
The effect it had on paul was to want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading ability .
The author organizes the article into three different sections .
It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did .
Also if one made all the plastics the same length .
Mr. Leonard helps to push Paul on and off the track to perform well and try hard .
most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm .
This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on .
The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor .
Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane .
Based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab , the reader can tell that Rose is a caring person .
Lastly , you would need to know how much distilled water that you need .
He just wants the reader to want to keep reading keep it intersenting .
Knowing this information , it had a great effect on Paul .
I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information , what are four samples ?
The 'What is Space Junk ? '
and so on and so fourth .
a ) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest .
4 .
This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem .
What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person .
You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers .
^p The student could have specified the weight to add .
He almost draws closer to Mr. Leonard because he realizes they both have something in common .
It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm .
Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass .
She does not have much time to do so , and is often too tired to even finish .
They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment .
.
Comparing it to the others , it streched the furthest .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers .
Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least .
I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on .
black : : Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter .
which is super hot .
Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation .
Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well .
Rose feels responsible to help her brother .
Paul soon found out that Mr. Leonard was just like him and Paul wanted to achieve for Mr. Leonard .
Crash Course talks about how space junk may interfer with spacecrafts and other object .
They could have also add more trials to improve their design .
white : : i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white .
I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers .
white : : It would make it cooler than the other colors .
He sees that he has become quite the athlete , just like Mr. Leonard .
Paul now understands why Mr.Leonard wanted to help Paul be on the track team .
Learning Mr. Leonard 's background information , Paul becomes more interested in his life .
We had no learning centers in our school .
^p 2 .
( 4 ) The protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes .
Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard 's track talents .
I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant .
Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability .
It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble .
Meaning that Paul was going to teach him a little bit .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star , and that he could not read .
I can also see that type A streched the least amount .
The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain .
The third section is titled , 'Crash Course ' .
He related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud .
It ends in a conclussion paragraph .
There are many traits that describe Rose .
Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard 's past and is surprised .
That is when he found hurdles .
He has felt the same way before and still does in school .
Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable , stretching an average of 11mm .
Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp .
Lastly , you would need to know how long to note samples for .
We see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with Anna .
Paul questions Mr. Leonard about college and discovers that Mr. Leonard had the same reading problems Paul has .
Lastly , I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with .
They should of had a control grap .
Pandas can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to even outer space .
A panda and a koala bear are similar because they pretty much each only one specific thing .
The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
Rose is hopeful .
Also , they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy .
Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit .
The author organized the article using topic headlines .
To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor .
Paul wants to be like Mr. Leonard but instead he wants to survive college .
When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read .
Rose is very caring towards her family .
Rose is a very caring person .
They think its a major threat to the food chain and to biodiversity .
That 's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm .
that is not specified .
Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy .
The author organizes his articles into sections .
Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items ?
It includes headings with short paragraghes under them .
^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2 .
Although the groups results are not valid .
This means that other animals , spreading endangered species , will not be introduced to having them there .
The name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about .
Also they both eat basically the same type of food , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
Whereas , pythons have a much larger diet and con eat almost anything .
The last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article .
Rose is willing to work for her family and do anything for them .
You feel okay ? '
Mr. Leonard explains that he did n't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now .
Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers .
Plastic D could have be stretched .
Pandas in China care very similar to koalas in Australia , they 're both a species of specialist .
light gray : : Light Gray .
One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights .
They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were .
The group also does not tell you how to way each sample 's mass .
They both can only eat one type of food .
Example : 'What is space junk ?
In the first trial it stretched 20mm , and in the second trial it stretched 23mm .
Italso means itchanges the enviornmental chain .
A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second .
So over all he did really well oragnizing this article .
Mr. Leonard did n't have learning centers , Paul realized how blessed he really was .
a .
It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2 .
This progression gives the reader a solid grasp of the Space Junk problem .
Darkness ?
The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star .
After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment .
There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment .
' C'mon , Mr. leonard , ' I said walking back toward school .
Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read .
black : : Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most .
What should we lable the 4 containers as ?
After that he explains how space junk is created , which is by free-orbiting satellites crashing into each other .
In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble , limestone , wood , and plastic .
The author organizes this article by using different sections .
It also explains why it is a problem and how the problem is being fixed .
It 's a meteor ! '
The panda and koala are different from a python because they are specialists and a python is a generalist .
I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2 .
These are information 's I need to replicate the procedure .
A python on the other hand is able to live and survive in many habitats .
He then use the next sectoin , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
You might also need to know to know the constants .
Lastly , I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer .
You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples .
1 .
Where as the python eats just about everything .
Day or night ?
They eat only one thing ; pandas eat bamboo , and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
This would provide a constant to compare the results to .
the person lets you know what the sections are about .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat nothing but one particular plant .
For example , the subtopic 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Paul takes this information as an encouragement .
First the author starts with an introduction to get your attention .
It 's a meteor !
This is what she tries to portray to Anna .
I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person .
They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples .
One trait that can describe Rose is supportive .
Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
( line 38-39 ) .
Paul felt more of a connection after he had found out about Mr. Leonard 's struggles .
If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers , where do they go for 24 hours ?
Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can live many places .
Next , tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein .
The author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover .
The procedure given does n't have enough information so that someone could replicate it .
black : : The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house .
Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways .
^p b ) 1 ) Made all the types start out in the same length .
Also , he feels that he can compensate for Mr. Leonard 's training by teaching him to read .
They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample . ''
Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat .
These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment .
One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring .
This gives Paul hope that he can be good at something too .
Other pairs of the word were they used to leaves live .
How much vinegar to pour into the samples ? .
How much water do you rinse them with and for how long ?
Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back , not with money but with knowledge .
He then talks about space debris from old satellites .
So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read .
After reading the groups procedure , there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment .
I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author .
They differ from pythons because a python is a generalist , who can live anywhere .
In the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
Another process is using a protein channel .
They must should be specific .
I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings .
this could also effect the mass of the material .
When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard , he seemed very suprised .
This shows that Rose is a caring person .
This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng .
Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties .
First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container .
They could have used more trials .
Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest .
Then , the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college , which seems to inspire him .
Then the author gives some information about how dangerous space junk can be .
1 .
How pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat one thing nothing but it .
Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm .
`` Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because of what they eat .
Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one .
Koalas and pandas are both different from pythons have many different places they live in the world .
One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights .
he is surprised that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college .
She does n't like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys .
Then he explains what makes the 'Space Junk . '
1 .
In the introduction , the author states that space junk is a great concern to government space agencies .
Rose cares for her family , not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt .
First , the author starts out with what the article is going to be about .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala are different from a python because pythons eat other animals .
But the Koala and China Panda are specialist animals and they eat plants like bamboo and leaves . ''
^p ( b ) However , there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved .
The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results .
he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard 's words were all too familiar . '
The author organizes the article by catching your attention with shocking statements made in the introduction .
The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results .
I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler .
Mr. Leonard was a track star .
Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide .
Panda 's and koalas are both herbivoures and eat plants to survive .
First , I would need to the materials needed for the lab .
The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment .
Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend ?
In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information .
Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm .
Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things .
For example , how much vinegar should be poured into each container ?
He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring .
`` Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment , one is todo more trials .
white : : I chose the color white for the doghouse .
By having this information , the lab will be more accurate and correct .
White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color .
Then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is .
The `` '' aliens '' '' will then disrupt the biodiversity if it is not held under control .
Next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it .
When Rose is talking to her sister , Anna she tries to look at the bright side of things .
The procedure does not state what the four samples they are testing .
In the he talks about how little pieces of matter are a big deal in the atmosphere .
They helped eachother out .
Paul finds out , like him , Mr. Leonard can not read but can run track .
You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass .
The author organized the article in way to guide the reader along with the information .
but he labels 'is ' itallicized because he is trying to make a point .
Paul feels the same way as Mr. Leonard does about not being a good reader .
which is a centered post or any experiment .
Because Me .
She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family .
She could just law down and say ' I quit , ' but she does n't .
a ) In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics .
First he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance .
what are the samples ?
To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure .
Paul does n't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track .
Paul complies and meets Mr. Leonard in the gym , where a basketball team is playing .
Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read .
That will improve the results . ''
So Paul can kind of relate to this .
This process is repeated until a stop code is reached .
She would rather suffer herself than make anyone else hurt .
Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer .
He first talks about Space Junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space .
These two things must be done to ensure validity .
The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to .
The order of the information makes sense in the human mind .
The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh .
This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments .
a .
Then , the second section is titled 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Then , the author describes what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk . '
In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm .
I agree that 'space junk ' could become a big problem .
Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data .
The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA , to begin protein synthesis.4 .
In the article called 'Crash Course ' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008 .
The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results .
black : : Black would be the best color , because it wou ld keep the house warmer .
During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
The trait that Rose has is responsability .
They are almost alike .
Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem .
He felt sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because he could n't read like him .
I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers .
They are both different than pythons because pythons are generalists , 'What generalists favor is change . '' ''
`` A ) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least .
Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted .
This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy .
This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you .
In the article it say panda 's eat bamboo exclusively and Koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
Rose feels grateful after talking to her Aunt Kolab .
Rose is caring .
Finally in the last paragraph , the reader talks about how scientists are trying to solve the problem .
You know that he surprised because , he confronts him about it .
So Paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways .
One trait described in the story from Rose talking to Anna is caring .
The panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves .
That is when Paul realized that he and Mr. Leonard were alike in that way .
I would need to know several things before replicating this job .
Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm .
They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment .
Right now there is no constant in the experiment .
Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment .
They are moving northward and hold a potential threats to more northern ecosystem an could cause problems .
a . )
In the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family .
Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure .
How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using .
Each section relates to the main idea , which is that there is waste orbiting in space .
In her conversation with Anna rose appears to be really hopeful .
Lastly he tells some specific things that have happen in space .
After this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
She tell Anna that their brother will get a job after college to pay for their college education .
The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container ?
1 .
So 'Crash Course ' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
'What is Space Junk ' , is the title for the first couple of paragraphs .
^p 2 . )
Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane .
This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help .
b ) The student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial .
^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic .
Paul does not feel sorry for him just simply wants to help him as his friend had helped Paul .
They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
responding : air temp .
The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample .
How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use ?
This student only had two trials instead of three .
1 .
a ) I conclude , that Plastic type A stretched the most ( 2ml ) .
Dark colors absorb more heat energy .
The significance of the word invasive is that these reptiles are called invasive .
Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas era eucalyptus leaves .
black : : the darker the color , the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer .
In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm .
In the converstation between Rose and Anna , a reader can depict that Rose is caring of others .
Also , about how America and Russian satellites crashed into eachother right about earth .
He explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky .
Rose is careing person .
then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be .
Pythons are an example of invasive species .
The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain .
This made Paul respectful and obedient to him .
Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use .
Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure .
Thus , the word invasive demonstrates a central conflict in the article . ''
One process used by cells is endocytosis .
what material ?
The author started with an opening paragraph explaining what the article is going to be discussing .
They describe how it is becoming more and more of a problem .
The first was space junk , that described what space junk is , and how it came about .
tool bad ?
Type A stretched an average of 11mm , type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm .
The length of each plastic shows the same .
Rose is a very caring person .
The author first begins on getting attention and becoming interested in this article .
In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most .
Then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk . '
At first the author brings you in with starting sentence .
Panda bears and koala bears are similar because they both eat one specific thing .
How much vinegar do I put into the containers ?
Paul says , 'Mr .
What type of containers will be needed .
I would also need to no how much of each material to use .
There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard .
Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading .
The introduction is an attention grabber so you will want to read the article .
Well a python is a generalist and eats any thing that is isining and small enough .
The author organizes this article 'Orbiting Junk ' into specific sections .
After reading the procedure some things are still unclear .
She cares for her family .
rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain .
a ) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched .
I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Also , he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise .
Like What Is Space Junk ?
He doesnt just put everything together , he makes subtitles .
'He had to go .
Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged .
They break it into sections , which allows the reading to get a better understaning .
The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B .
You need a set amount .
It would n't be too hot or to too cold .
they eat very little .
They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled .
As college life caught up with him , he realized that he could n't do it .
In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
It should also tell the size , and or type of containers used in this experiment .
The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out .
He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought .
In other words , pandas and koalas are not something to really worry about unlike pythons .
It made him confident that Mr. leonard could make him great .
That is how we get Space Junk .
^p b .
He realizes that someone else had the same difficulties that he is having .
4 .
It talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology .
Based
The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand .
Then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about Space junk .
She feels bad for the way she is feeling about her familie 's situation right now .
He asked him about it .
Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment .
The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul .
For example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
The third section , 'Crash Course ' , shows how the problem began .
The author organizes this article in a very comprehensive way .
Bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and reducing sources .
These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid .
Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials .
Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two .
Respect .
I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway .
I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material .
He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage .
The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed .
There should be a control included within the experiment .
One trait that Rose demonstrates is that she is hard working .
Third they tell you what can happen with all the space junk .
Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples .
This leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead ' satellites cause , and so on .
One trait that can describe Rose would be concern .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment .
rose is resposible .
It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites , capsules , telescopes etc .
Also , describe how long the plastic types were before she started her experiment .
white : : The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways .
Next , we move on to What Is Space Junk , which explains the history of space exploration .
Therefore , light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse .
First , it does n't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers .
In the text Rose is worried about hurting her mother or her aunt .
Paul asked him 'why did n't you tell me about this ' .
This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by .
a .
I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too .
And probably her aunt would tell her mom . '
Rose said , 'Only if you already have everything . '
He realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined .
I especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
It also makes him feel like he can acheive things , that he did n't know he could .
The background information changes Paul 's view on the Mr. Leonard .
In China pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists .
It also presents a solution .
Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest .
The final section talks about the power of space junk falling from the atmosphere .
It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles .
Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him .
The average for the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) c for black .
Type two is active transport .
Rose is a rather optimistic person .
This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading .
Her aunt then begins to question her about if she feels weighted down .
This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out .
Paul now realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the fact that they both have trouble reading .
Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows .
Because he cant read all that well , but he is good at track .
Telling him ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' as they walked back towards the school .
Then the plastic cups will stretch .
but with a unique spin .
a ) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm .
In return , Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
Finding one with a tracker in the python 's stomach concludes that this reptile is invasive . ''
You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting .
Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this .
He was suprised .
Knowing this , Paul was releaved and was glad to help Mr. Leonard with his reading .
4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are born specialists .
I have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place .
'It 's time to start your training . '
Thirdly , they let you know that small problems are happening but it is a big deal .
I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen .
( a ) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest .
China 's panda 's eat bamboo and koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves which are both plants .
When she finished those tasks , she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion .
Also by using the same weight to weights .
Paul had no idea that his new coach was even a runner .
He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him .
They also both only eat one thing exclusively panda : bambo & koalas ; eucalyptus leaves .
Then , the author explains the dangers of the space junk .
This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him .
Also what you would use to find the mass .
Paul only finds out about him when he talks to the school 's track coach .
After mRNA leaves the nuclues , it goes to ribosomal RNA .
We had no learning center in our school .
The passage is written like an essay with an introduction , body , and a conclusion .
How much vinegar ?
' , the author writes about what he/she will be explaining .
I would also need to know what the four different samples were .

I believe that it had a motivational effect on him .
Rose , to me , seems to be a very hard working person .
In 'Crash Course ' , the author elaborates on space junk , including a specific example .
Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbavors .
It caused some effect on Paul once he knew .
Then Crash Course which is about dead satellites craching .
I need to know how much vinegar .

It also suprised him that Mr. Leonard had never told him about his records .
Towards the end of the story , Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard and his past .
What containers do I put them in ?
They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using .
It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics .
Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard .
after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
Look up in the sky !
Plastic type A stretched the least .
This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot .
Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals . ''
He discovered he broke records , and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life .

A ribosome attaches to the mRNA ( rRNA ) .
) The types of samples used should be in the procedure .
Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics .
At last , he talked about tiny bits of space trash .
white : : I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature .
Also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions .
For example , should they be left covered or not ?
The author also organizes it by the titles of the paragraphs .
After that how little bits can make a big deal later on .
Next , tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein .
The panda and koala differ from pythons because pythons eat mostly other animal .
One trait that Rose possesses is being compasionate towards others .
He felt familiar with the emotions of embarrrassment that Mr. Leonard felt .
They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample .
They do n't state how they find the mass of each sample .
The adaptability of the python makes it different from koalas and pandas .
The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics .

light gray : : Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate .
Paul was honored for Mr. Leonards help .
The subtopic What Is Space Junk ?
He asked , Why didnt you tell me about this ?
He concludes with why these issues matter and how people should work to confront them .
While speaking to Anna , Rose displays this specific character trait .
I think Paul also felt , that he was n't the only one going through learning diableties .
Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
^p b ) The students could have done more trials .
They both are good hurdlers , they could n't read , and they felt embarrassed about it .
( sentence number 12 )
I would need to know how big each individed
The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is .
Rose has a trait of unselfishness .
Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane .
Then in the next section , the author gives the reader background information on space junk .
I think the students should have started out with the same mass .
So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to .
Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go .
Mr. Leonard did n't have a Learning Center back then , that would help him with his grades .
Paul refers to this because he ca n't read either .
Another thing the students forgot was the different samples , what are they ?
The second process is osmosis .
All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways .
Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard .
Both of them are like one another and know how the other feels .
In order to replicate this experiment , the group 's procedure should include more specific information .
Mr. Leonard said , ' I remember , best race of my life . '
The panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
Pandas in China , and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialists .
All in all , Mr. Leonard , wants Paul to succeed unlike he did .
Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not .
It 's a ... tool bag ? ' .
This way it will have more time to stretch . ''
The student could 've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were .
Also , the students should have specified the weight being used .
'Rose did n't answer .
you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer .
I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were .
He uses sub headings such as 'What Is Space Junk ' , and 'Crash Course ' .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia whereas they can only live in certain ares .
The first catagory 'What is space junk ? '
Mr. Leonard then tells him , ' I was a good athlete ... but not a good student .
I would need to know the original size of each of the four different samples .
A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to use .
He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed .
Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was ; Paul could n't read .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him .
These foreign predators are taking root because of humans and there condessness .
At least she feels responsible for everyone .

^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group .
Next he explains what space junk is .
white : : White could be a color for the doghouse .
Paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read .
You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment .
This article is very well organized .
The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size .
In the final section they explain how the space garbage can cause complications for spacecraft .
black : : This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer .
They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left , right or anything
'Anna , ' Rose said .
Next Anna stands up and says Rose sounds like mom .
Styrofoam ?
for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk .
Such as why , out of all people he choose Paul to work with .
They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using .
Then he lets you know how much space junk is in space like satellites .
I think that he was determined to do better .
Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals , Mr. Leonard even broke records .
This pertains to the article because one point of view considers the python invasive .
Chinas panda and Australias koala bear are both specialist species .
Then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed .
Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete .
Also , pythons do well around humans , allowing them to live as pets .
Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate , but Paul can simpathize .
The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are : ^p 1 .
One Trait that would describe Rose would be helpful .
' , 'Crash Course , ' and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results .
Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid .
Rose 's aunt asks her if she felt weighed down .
To replicate the experiment , a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample .
This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow . '
Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2 .
Pythons can barley survive in cooler climates , where they live should be warm .
It 's a meteor !
I can see that Rose tries to be positive about life with her sister Anna .
Diffusion , movement from high to low concentration .
At the end of the story Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him read .
Pandas from China and koala from Australia both eat almost nothing but one particular thing .
Mr. Leonard could n't read .
Then he tells you what space junk is basically .
a .
Lastly , we need to know the concentration of the vinegar .
The different sections the authour uses are 'Orbiting Junk ' as the introduction , 'What is Space Junk ? '
The least stretchy would be type A , stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2 .
Also , in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut .
Rose is caring .
Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2 .
Paul grabbed Mr. Leonards hand and told him now its time for your training .
Pythons eat other animals , they are carnivores .
'learning center ' 'why ? '
Paul finding out that Mr. Leonard could not read has a very strong affect .
What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use .
'He had to go .
The student could make sure each test was in same environment .
It made Paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend .
These codons code for specific amino acids .
Rose is very understanding .
Paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports .
describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists .
The author organizes the article in three sections .
The second section was about what happens when satellites collide , 'Crash Course ' .
^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length .
Even though things are hard for her right now she is n't giving up on things .
The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type .
One example is in paragraph two .
He shows this thankfulness with his desire to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read .
One trait that can describe Rose is thoughtful .
^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant .
This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment .
Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight .
How much vinegar should be poured into the containers ?
You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples .
Osmosis : Diffusion involving water .
He then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk .
Mr. Leonard did n't have help with his grades .
The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
This happens continuously to make proteins .
a .
How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using ?
Rose , although feeling pressured , does n't want to make things harder on anyone or to hurt anyone .
the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
which shows that she does n't want to see her aunt get hurt .
This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average .
So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
`` Based on the students data , plastic type B stretched the most .
When Paul found the information about him he was surprised .
Afterwards , Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate .
He describes the outter space , with all of the trash floating around in it , from previous astronotes .
You also need to know how much vinegar you using , you may also need to know how much you
The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole , only sizable for it .
white : : White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins .
He uses these subtitles to orginize his article .
Startng the article off with some hurmor 'Grab your telescope !
To replicate the experiment , the Students need to include more detail in their procedure .
So he began teaching Mr. Leonard how to read .
Lastly , the author explains how dangerous space trash and space pollution is .
We would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each .
This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same .
The author first draws the reader in with the introduction .
Paul knows what its like to not be able to read .
It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it .
Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability .
Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave .
'Now , instead of two disabled satellites , there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space . '
The author then explains why space junk is a problem and specific examples on what could happen .
Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul .
They also could have been more detailed about how much weight , they were adding to the plastic .
Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too .
white : : If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun .
And train me .
It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in .
Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type .
When Mr. Leonard was in school , they did n't have learning centers to help people read .
black : : I think black would be the best color for the doghouse .
Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read .
The tRNA codes for an amino acid .
Rose is respectful of her elders and thinks about other people first .
This will continue until it reaches a stop codon .
`` `` A python swallowed n alligator . '' '' ''
the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight .
The last section tells you why it is a big deal .
i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
They use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared .
The koala which lives in Australia , only eats eucalyptus leaves .
He emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space .
Paul then decided to do something for Mr. Leonard , and tell him to start his training .
Rose cares very deeply about others .
Both creatures depend in mainly one food source .
the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
Determined , she sticks to what is important to her .
b ) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched .
This show how he felt the need to return the help .
white : : The best paint color for the doghouse is white .
The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family .
The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours .
For example , 'Crash Course ' explains the colliding of satellites .
Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul , he returns the favor .
During the story 'Gifts ' Paul learns some interesting and shocking information about Mr Leonard .
first , the aurthor grabbed the readers attention .
In her conversation with Anna she says , 'We have do to our part to help Paul finish college .
the black colored lid is 9 ( DEG ) warmer than the white col ored lid .
and there are two paragraphs in that section .
Rose is very understanding of other people .
and this section has 2 paragraphs specifically talking about space junk .
The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container .
And realizes that they are a lot a like
My conclusion will be that with the added weight , the plastics stretched .
During the story , the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house .
In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done .
For and pandas and koalas mostly eat leaves and stuff like that .
When Paul finds out about all of this , he wants to help Mr. Leonard .
In the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space .
Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used .
As well as try half with weights and the other half with none .
The amounts are not specified .
The amino acids form an amino acid chain , which is also called a protein .
'Crash Course ' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause .
Rose is caring .
One trait that Rose shows is compasion .
Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic .
Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples .
Once its in , the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three .
Active transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using the cell 's energy .
So , Paul decides to teach his teacher how to read once and for all .
This group left same very important thing out of their procedure .
The author organizes the article like this to make the reader understand without getting confused .
You feel okay ? '
I can lab make a solid conclusion .
Mr. Leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college .
Mr. Leonard , like Paul , had trouble reading .
The effects that Mr. Leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data .
The pandas consume only bamboo while koalas , eat eucalyptus leaves .
Rose is a responsible person .
And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ .
Also , by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes , but also 10 minutes .
Also adding a control would be helpful as well .
They are not natural there and they disrupt natures balance .
He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk ' with his primary thesis .
I would need to know what were the four different samples .
A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most .
She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her .
`` The group was not very specific in their procedures .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy .
The author organizes the article with specific titles for each section .
A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere .
The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic .
' , 'Crash Cource ' , and 'Little Bits , Bit a Big Deal . '
'Crash Course , which was to provide details about how satellies have crashed due to this debris .
Translation Occurs ; 2 .
When Paul finds out about the background information on Mr. Leonard he is shocked .
The author organizes the article by writing about different topics in a section .
One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it .
a .
The least stretched plastic was type A .
Further on , the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be .
^p 3 ) How much vinegar to put the samples in .
This introduces what his paper will be about .
directs that .
The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2 .
All they tell us is vinegar .
One would be to say how large each sample should be .
Finally , in the last section , the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced .
shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp .
In sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one .
and he got an unexpected answer .
The author organizes the article by seperating different subjects under subtitle .
Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials .
Mr. Leonard 's background information had a large effect on Paul .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome .
Thats been training him on the track everyday .
The author organize the article by brecking it down into peices .
Another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections .
We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container .
Passive transport does not use channel proteins , nor does it use energy .
a ) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics .
Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does .
As we see when he says 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation .
For instance one plastic with no weight .
Therefore , the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples .
Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample .
The author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way .
This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems .
Also , to get better results the student should 've conducted a third trial .
She cares about others .
Rose is very gentle .
Rose does n't want to hurt her family becasue she is caring .
One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic .
Finally , you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours .
Pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves .
white : : using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day .
Pandas & koalas both have specialized diets .
when he hid that secret about him quitting track because of his grades shocked the narrator .
Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes .
Paul knows how that feels .
To conclude this experiment .
This could effect the mass of the object at the end .
By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment .
It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm .
The author organizes this article by like ideas .
Both the panda and koalas differ from pythons because pythons are `` generalists '' , not `` specialist '' .
A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment .
These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA .
The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport , also .
The effect the background information has on Paul is that Paul realizes he can help Mr. Leonard .
Therefore , they can live in many areas and are called generalists .
Paul then feels motivated to 'train ' Mr. Leonard in reading .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps .
They display some of the same traits .
Plastic type A is stronger than the rest .
This meaning that the first section titled 'What is Space Junk ? '
After that it was time to do homework . '
Rose is willing to work for her family because that is tradition that occurs in Cambodia .
Nonative animals invade a land and sort of offset the balance of nuture in that area .
You would need to know what materials to use , the amount of vinegar to use , and .
Pandas and koalas also are confined to one part of the world , while pythons are now in many .
^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one .
Paul looks at Mr. Leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past .
The next section is titled 'Crash Course ' .
Paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like Mr.Leonard did .
some of the subtitles they used are What Is Space Junk ?
He does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk .
Second He or she talks about the satellites crashing .
Since both of them could n't read in school and wre both great runners .
The author organizes this article in a very intelligent way .
I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out .
Next , the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk .
We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups .
The author organizes the article by using headings .
It 's a ... tool bag ? '
This means it has more elasticity than the others .
Paul responds by feeling more of a connection to Mr. Leonard .
For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black .
The side heading prozide an organized map for the reader to follow .
In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm .
The second section explains what space junk is , and how it got there .
Osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane .
Also , we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open .
The author organizes the article by using catchy phrases and useful information to better understand the subject .
^p B ) 1 .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
The word invasive pertains to the rest of the article in that it is describing the animals .
He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training ' in reading .
Next , they talk about how harmful these tiny fragments can be .
a ) .
These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment .
Three ways to do this are active , passive , and diffusion .
They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader 's attention , 'Grab your telescope !
He puts things down by there importance , uses tone of voice , and organizes his thoughts well .
One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything .
He found out that Mr. Leonard also had , and still does , trouble reading .
Next it talks about satellites and how they run the risk of colliding with each oter .
The author puts the story in different sections .
Then he explains what the 'space junk ' actually is .
Therefore , Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading .
The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for .
For example a graph chart .
I would need to know where to put all of the different containers .
Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein , this uses energy .
But then he is more understanding as he finds out that he could n't read .
He could not read .
An example is 'Its only been four months , ' Rose said as gently as she could .
The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results .
Then , they explain to the reader what space junk is and that it is dangerous .
This includes the problem of satelights running into each other .
Paul felt inspired .
He wondered why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him this .
He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals .
black : : this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer .
This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center .
It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner .
You 'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs .
There are several things this group should have included , in their procedure .
Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2 , 20mm .
Invasive means a newly introduced species to the area , but it has a negative effect .
Rose said to Anna .
And lastly , they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment .
In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12 .
They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container .
It is a very helpful way in letting us find information on a given idea .
of the room .
He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem .
They differ from pythons because pythons eat a variety of things not just one thing .
He describes how satellites have a risk of colliding since there is no one controlling them .
Also , you would need to how to determine mass .
In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12 .
Through osmosis , water can freely pass through the membrane .
^p 3 .
Rose was trying to let Anna know that everything would be alright once Paul recieved a job .
We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2 .
I mean he had some because he never cried and complained , and Mr. Leonard reached out to him .
He also tells us how an asronaut lost his tool bag in space .
The background information shown who Mr. Leonard aws in the past .
It 's a ... tool bag ? '
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' is significance to the article because it is the article .
Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk ' are found in space from these previous space missions .
It 's a comet !
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by eating plants & only plants .
The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length .
When the coach writes down the URL for the Track website when Paul gets home he checks it out .
To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples .
Second , you need a control for comparison purposes .
It helps organize the ideas and keeps the same subject in an area .
Each of these titles informs you about what your going to be reading about in the pargraph below .
Also , he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to .
The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same .
You can tell that she cares about her little sister .
a ) .
