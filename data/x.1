You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment .
You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure .
You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container .
Some additional information you will need are the material .
You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample .
Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar .
In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers .
There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment .
Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are .
A good procedure would have specified this
In order the replicate the experiment you need
You would also have to know how big in size each container was .
They needed to include what time they started and when they ended .
Also the amount of vinegar they used .
Also the size of each sample .
In this group 's procedure , they do not state what
I would also need to know how much vinegar to use .
I would also need to know what type of containers to use .
Well I would need to know what the problem statement is .
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material .
State how long you are rising the materials in water .
( ex 5 minutes )
A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results . ''
The container 's reapetedly , separate but identicle conatainer .
What containers should we use ?
In order to complete this experiment , three aditional thing should be included .
The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup .
The second is to list the far samples in the procedure .
The third is to record the information obtained .
You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup .
You need a set amount .
You could also do the time at different times .
Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material .
We need to know how big the sample would have to be .
To replicate the experiment , the procedure would require more detail .
This group left same very important thing out of their procedure .
I would need the amount of roch in each container .
I would need the amount of vinegar of r container .
I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container .
I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant .
I would also need the amount trials done .
1.A list of materials and safety requirements .
^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers .
^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group .
They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams . ''
The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container .
They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in .
You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container .
I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment .
Next , we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material .
Will we completely submerge it or only partially ?
Finally , we need to know which materials to use .
The data indicates them , but the procedure does not .
Should it be sunny , dark , windy , hot , cold , etc .
This experiment is missing too much information .
Therefore , the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment .
Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added .
The students need to say what the samples are .
They need to
The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control .
If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp .
Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar .
A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup .
In order to replicate the experiment , i would need some additional information .
you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample .
The problem does not state what the four different samples are .
The amount of vinegar could impact the mass .
Different tempuratures might affect the different samples .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit .
Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator .
The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used .
Also , how much distilled water I would need to use .
In order to complete this experiment , you would need additional information .
You might also need to know to know the constants .
What type of vinegar , and what time you started .
One thing is the amount of vinegar used .
Another is How much water to use when rinsing it .
The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours .
There were a few problems with this procedure .
I think the students should have started out with the same mass .
What type of vinegar and does temperature matters .
The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are : ^p 1 .
^p 2 .
) The types of samples used should be in the procedure .
^p 3 . )
Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently , making the experiment inaccurate .
Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume .
And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers .
I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups .
I would need to know where to put all of the different containers .
or by a light source makes a difference too .
`` These students procedure was not a reliable one .
The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses .
Is there only reducing to ism the `` '' sample . '' ''
They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup .
The material also that not include in control groups .
which is a centered post or any experiment .
They student variable unchecked .
They also included only the trial . ''
-In step 1 , we need to know what samples .
It should list the 4 types of rock .
The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure .
For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used .
In addition , there is an information about how they determined the mass .
`` 1 .
What kind of `` '' sample of material '' '' are you using .
2 .
How much vinegar should we put in the containers .
3 .
They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample . ''
I need to know how much vinegar .
I need to pour on each of pour seperate , but dentical containers .
I need to know what the four different samples are .
The greas would need to identify
The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment .
A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment .
The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without .
The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain .
That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab .
I would need to also know which type of container to use .
So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing .
Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled ?
And what are the four different samples ?
These are information 's I need to replicate the procedure .
The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment .
Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials .
Explain what the four different samples would be .
^p 2 .
Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup .
^p 4 .
Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples .
) , and how long to rinse for .
How much vinegar rinse or how long
Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well .
I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container .
Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers .

^p 3 .
Goggle inclusion would also be rise .
The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing .
They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format .
How long do you rinse the samples ?
Do the samples stay outside or inside ?
Day or night ?
You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same .
They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need .
Third , i would need to know what type of container i should use .
These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment .
The students need to include what the samples were .
The students should also include the temp .
that the containers were stored at for 24 hours .
Lastly , they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container .
They could 've put the same amount or different amount .
They could 've put little or a lot .
balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic .
How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass .
To replicate this experiment , I would need to know more information .
I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen .
Also , I do n't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup .
First they should list the samples they used .
Marble , limestone , wood and plastic in their procedure .
Not just leaving it out of their processes .
I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container .
How long to rinse it in water ( materials ) .
And what kind of container casinial use .
I also need to know how much vinegar is needed .
Furthermore , I need to know the amount of each sample needed .
Their are three things wrong with this procedure .
The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water .
Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit .
Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ?
Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment .
The procedure is very vague .
A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment .
Therefore the students should specify the marble , limestone , wood + plastic .
How much vinegar you pour into the cups .
What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use .
Otherwise , we could n't even start the experiment .
To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information .
For example , how much vinegar should be poured into each container ?
With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment .
All they tell us is vinegar .
Also , what is the size of the containers ?
How much of each sample is being poured into the container ?
How much vinegar would you pour in each cup .
how would also need to know if they used the same size cup .
These things are all very important information that was n't included .
You would need a sample of each of the substances .
As well as knowing what type of each substance you need .
All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment .
First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass .
In case there was no data table present .
I would also need to no how much of each material to use .
It would also put what effect of materials its going to use .
In order to replicate this procedures , you would need to know
You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
How much vineger do you have to pour into each container .
And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data .
We need those information to know how to do this experiment .
In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain , you need additional information .
First you need to know what type of samples your using .
Second , the procedure did not specify how big each samples should be .
Having different sizes might change the results .
Another information
I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment .
I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container .
Without these , I could not replicate this experiment .
And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar .
We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup .
We would also need a control .
So would need to place something in regular water as well .
You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample .
The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it .
Also you do not know what the four samples are .
In the second step how much vinegar should be poured .
A last step should also be included to say repeat .
One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container .
Each sample should be the same size .
What type of vinegar it is should also be included .
Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure .
They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container .
The group also does not tell you how to way each sample 's mass .
^p 2 .
^p 3 .
How much vinegar and the students pour into each container .
It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used .
With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials .
Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into .
Should it be poured limestone , a block of wood etc .
All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment .
This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples .
This group is lacking a control group in their procedure .
Third , there is no control in this experiment .
They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control .
It should say what each `` '' sample '' '' is in the procedures .
A list of materials . ''
and specify the size and type of the containers used ( beakers )
Lastly , we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container .
Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows .
First , how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers ?
Secondly , how large should the samples be ?
Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment .
You would need to know what the four different samples are .
Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
Lastly , you need to know what temperature to store them at .
Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment .
For example , do they want us to use the same materials ?
Of course they do , so that 's one .
Another is , what kind of containers do they want us using ?
We can use plastic or metal or another .
Lastly , you would need to know how much distilled water that you need .
Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record .
The procedure should include what the four different samples are .
At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified .
The procedure should also encourage repetition .
Human and equipment errors as always possible .
Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary .
Finally , the procedure does not include a control .
This does n't give the readers anything to compare the results .
You would need to know how big of cups to use .
What type of container should the sample be put into ?
how should i determine the mass of the different samples ?
How much vinegar to pour into the samples ? .
`` You need something like a scale to determine the mass .
`` `` Determine the mass of four different samples '' '' .
You need to identify what that sample .
You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed . ''
Determine the mass of four samples of what ?
How much vinegar is needed in the containers ?
You would need a scale to measure the different containers .
Are the different containers made of the same material ?
I would need to know several things before replicating this job .
Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on .
In the procedure the samples ' identities are not given .
More information would be needed to replicate the experiment .
It needs to be explained what the samples are of .
It should say how much vinegar to use .
Also , it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar .
There should be a control included within the experiment .
Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass .
The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results .
I would also need to know what the four different samples were .
The additional information that should be included in this procedure is .
How much vinegar goes in each sample .
Where do the samples go to sit and dry at .
Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data .
There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment .
All these things are essential to replicating this experiment .
Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples .
Should I
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know : ^p 1 .
How much vinegar to put in each container ^p 2 .
What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying .
^p 4 .
How big the containers are ^p 5 .
What environment is the experiment taking place in ?
Hot , warm , freezing , wet etc .
The procedure should contain what different samples are going to weighed .
It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers .
They did n't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers .
This could effect the mass of the object at the end .
Second you will need to know the temperature of the room .
To make this experiment 's procedure complete , three additional things are needed .
These additional steps would make the procedure better .
Lastly does it matter the material of the container : glass , metal .
Throw away containers .
Also I would need to know where I should place a sample .
Also I would need to know how top measure the mass .
You would also need to know what four samples to use .
Step one really should go at the end .
You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers .
Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested .
Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it .
You would also need to know what type of materials you need .
) .
I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion .
The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items .
So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time .
I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers .
You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment .
One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container .
A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use .
Also , if they should all start out with the same mass or not .
Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ?
Inside , outside , by a window ?
1 .
Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock .
^p 2 .
Determine an amount of vinegar .
^p 3 .
Determine what type of containers are being used .
`` I would include the materials used or the `` '' samples '' '' .
An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance .
It 's very vague , so they should add more specific .
Say what sample to use in the experiment too .
you also need a control group .
To tell me what the samples are in the procedure .
^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers .
^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in .
Another problem is that they did n't mention how much vinegar should be used .
the samples should be kept at .
By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid .
The group will need
^p should they be relatively the same size ?
^p 2 .
How much vinegar should be poured into the containers ?
^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water ?
^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material ?
And what to use to determine the mass of them .
I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container .
I also would need to know how many trials were their .
In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used .
Also , you would need to how to determine mass .
Since there as the of materials
You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample .
Different amounts of vinegar would give different results .
To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor .
I would have to know whatknd of samples to use .
They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples .
This will make the procedure easier to follow .
How much vinegar is needed in each dish .
What is the sample material .
And how do you determine the mass .
And how much vinegar the students poured into each container .
What type of container , how much vinager .
Also what you would use to find the mass .
So the all came out equal .
To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples .
Also , there should be more specific size measurements of the containar .
Lastly , they never say how much vinegar to use .
^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment .
The procedure is unclear .
In order to effectively replicate this experiment .
It would help to know how large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount .
2. types of sampling .
3. containers size .
Also the type of container needed .
I would also need to know what the samples are .
To replicate this , I need to know what samples I 'm working with .
To the different samples were listed in the procedure , it would be betterunderstand .
But not how much vinegar was put into the containers .
In order to replicate this experiment , I would need to know many details .
I also would need to know how large each material is .
of the room .
Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment .
We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers .
We need to know this as well .
Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is , 1 .
By having this information , the lab will be more accurate and correct .
Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed .
What do you measure the mass in
And also the site of the container needed for this experiment .
They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container .
Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes .
I would need to know how big each individed
Where should the samples dry , warm , cold , in the sun ?
I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended .
I would need to know how much of each material will be needed .
or my results may vary .
^p + Temperature affects evaporation .
Also how much vinegar to put in the container .
How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water ?
Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment .
In their procedure , they also should have
( marble , limestone , wood and plastic ) .
^p ( 2 ) How much vinegar to add to each sample .
^p ( 3 ) How much of each sample to use .
With this additional information , one could now replicate the experiment .
`` To replicate the group 's experiment , more information is neccesary .
Finally , I would need to know what to label each container .
In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly .
What the four samples are .
They should also say what the sample is .
How much vinegar should be pour into the containers .
And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample .
In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well .
Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g .
The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples .
In order to replicate this experiment , additional information is needed .
First , the amount of vinegar would be needed .
In order to replicate the experiment , additional information is needed .
First , I would need to the materials needed for the lab .
I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used .
A third thing the procedure has n't told us is the amount of vinegar .
I would also need to know what type of container .
I would even like
Give a start and stop time put safety googles on .
Also , to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be .
In order to replicate the group 's procedure I would need some more information .
I would need to know what the samples were .
In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information .
First , they need to specity what the
you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample .
You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample .
Also what size container should be used .
Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at .
One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup .
Without this information , the results would be inaccurate .
This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment .
It is important to have them all be the same size .
I would also need to how much vinegars to put in the containers .
Styrofoam ?
covers ?
^p Initial amount for each samples . ''
Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup .
Wha sample materials are they useing .
Was each sample poured in to .
And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water .
Why could n't they just leave it how it was .
Lastly , i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment .
Beaker , test tube , a regular container ?
More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here .
Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples .
In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed .
The size of the container needs to be determined .
Finally it does n't say how long the sample should be rinced for .
If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated .
First , you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container .
Second , you need a control for comparison purposes .
Third , you need to state the size of the containers .
Also , I would need to know what material to put in each container .
I would also need to know the measurment .
I would need to know how much vinegar to add .
They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container .
They have actually determine the mass .
Then , how much vinegar should be added to each container .
What kind of containers ? Big small ?
what are the samples ?
What sample ?
what material ?
What containers and what are we supposed to label ?
the sample or what is being put into ?
To replicate this experiment you would need the following information .
a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample .
^p c Would need to know what materials to gather .
They do n't state what the samples have to be .
They also do n't say how much should the samples weigh .
They also do n't say how much vinegar should be used .
Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts .
Otherwise , the data can be affected without this constant .
This needs to be included in the procedure .
Also , you would need to know what size and shape the samples are .
`` The group was not very specific in their procedures .
Samples of what ?
They never say .
In the light or dark ?
First , I would need to know what type of material is being used .
in darkness outside ?
I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup .
These 3 changes to the procedure , will make the experiment easy for replicate .
You would need to know what samples you would need to use .
Then , I would need to know what the three samples are .
The amounts are not specified .
The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use .
Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment .
I would also need to know the problem to this experiment .
Also , around how much of the samples do you need ?
100g or 50g or 10g .
Also , how much vinegar to pour into each container .
They must should be specific .
`` There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment .
What size and configuration should the containers be ?
It says `` '' identical '' '' , but does not specify anything else .
Thirdly , how do we determine the mass of the samples ? ''
In step 2 , you need to be told how much vinegar to pour .
The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment .
You also need to know what the conditions are made out of .
Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in .
Lastly , what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment .
They would also need to know what containers they used .
In what unit ( grams ?
) .
In order to replicate the experiment , the group of students need a control .
In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar .
After reading the groups procedure , a few things are missing .
How much vinegar to use .
The temperature the experiment was conducted under .
How much of such sample should be used .
All this information is needed to replicate the experiment .
Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid .
This is needed for comparison .
A control ( one with just pure water ) is needed to increase validity .
Another thing the students forgot was the different samples , what are they ?
First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container .
Also the group should use a control in this experiment .
We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
And I would also need to know what shape the samples are .
Also what would those 4 materials be .
It never states what materials to use .
How much vinegar should be poured into cup ?
There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water .
1 .
What are the four different samples ?
^p 2 .
How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample ?
^p 3 .
How are you going to measure the mass ?
First , in the product it just said pour vinegar .
It did n't say how much which is important .
I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be .
I would also need to know how big each sample should be .
Also how big the container would be .
You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in .
1 .
What kind of samples ?
^p 2 .
How much vinegar ?
^p 3 .
What kind of container ?
Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically .
Storing the samples , is another vital area in this experiment .
To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information .
Different environments could affect the date .
Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data .
i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
The students should be more specific in giving the directions well .
After reading this experiment there is a lot I 'd need to know .
I would also need to know what sample goes in each container .
And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
You would need to know how big the containers were .
What containers do I put them in ?
How much vinegar do I put into the containers ?
Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours ?
Do I cover the containers ?
How do you measure the ending mass of each sample ?
Also , you would need to know what type if container to use .
You can not replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use .
The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be .
You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be .
The amount of vinegar needed is essential information .
For example , should they be left covered or not ?
They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added .
The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container .
Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar .
They also should add more trials for more accurate results .
There is also no indication when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples .
If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results .
Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples .
You 'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs .
They do n't state how they find the mass of each sample .
Lastly , they do n't give the names or amounts of each sample .
They do n't have a control to show how the others were affected .
You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used .
Second it does n't state what are the samples like what rocks they are .
It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble .
A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this .
A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with .
Also what type of containers should you put the samples in ?
How big should they be .
Also , step 3 should be switched with step 2 .
I would need to know how much vinegar they used .
Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers .

Additional information that would be needed .
Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things .
The
They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers .
They also never listed the materials that needed to be used . ''
One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment .
You would also need to have the samples all the same size .
They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container .
They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use .
Lastly , you would need to know how long to note samples for .
In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information .
That would also be helpful .

The procedure left out some information that is needed .
It should also tell you to do repeated trials .
`` Fix this experiment , the procedure needs additional information .
Then it needs to state how much of each `` '' sample '' '' .
You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers .
Just saying samples is not specific enough .
I should have the exact type of material .
Should I use a lot of vinegar , or a little ?
4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment .
I also need to know how to find the difference in mass .
1.How much vinegar & how big a container ?

How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for ?
You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system .
The procedure does not state what the four samples they are testing .
They have to be clear and actually name them also .
We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container .
It should have a constant mass for each of the samples .
( ie grams , pounds , ouples )
^p 2 ) How much vinegar I need to pour .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container .
Also , the size of the container would be helpful .

It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container .
It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be .
How much sample to add into each solution .
In order to replicate this experiment .
How much should you have in each container ?
They could have used more trials .
Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment .
Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be .
Material type A stretched the least , and material type B stretched the most .
Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A .
You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability .
They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time .
a .
b .
Based on the student 's data , plastic B stretched more .
Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag .
First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results .
The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials .
It is important to keep your constants , constant .
C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between .
^p B .
One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything .
What plastic , how long are they etc .
They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two .
A .
^p B .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm .
There for it stretched the greatest amount .
In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest .
A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most .
It stretched 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one .
Thus piece of info is crucial . ''
A .
The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm .
^p B .
Make a control having the clamp ( without weight ) be measured .
Also they could 've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial .
B .
a . )
The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A .

^p B .
Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two .
Also , she should tell what plastics were used .
a .
^p b .
For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes .
The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic .
In T1 it Stretched 22 mm , and in T2 it stretched 23mm .
The least stretched plastic was type A .
In T1 , A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm .
Constant keep the results of experiment valid .
a .
Out of all the plastic , plastic A is the stretchiest .
^p b .
A ) In conclusion , plastic B had the most stretchability .
Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data .
He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic .
Plastic type A was the stretchiest .
a ) Plastic B has the most stretchability .
Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity .
A ) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length .
A .
^p 1 .
Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment .
^p 2 .
Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp .
Also , the students could have conducted more trials .
The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident .
a ) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic .
It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials .
^p b ) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added .
This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant .
The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added .
a ) In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics .
Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period .
In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most .
Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm .
The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics . ''
Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials .
The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat .
The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps .
`` Based on the students data , plastic type B stretched the most .
^p b . )
Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment .
They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct .
Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most .
^p ( B ) The student could included more trials to add validity .
a . )
Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested .
^p b . )
The students can able more trials to their experiments .
Also , they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used .

Plastic type B was the stretchiest , while A stretched the least .
^p b 1 . )
Make sure the plastics were all the same length .
^p 2 . )
Measure the plastics during the process of stretching .
D stayed the same .
^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic .
They should of said how much the clamp weighed .
a ) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
It 's the stretchiest .
They could of repeated the procedure one more time .
They should of had a control grap .
In trial 1 it stretched 22mm , and trial 2 it streached 23mm .
Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid .
Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results .
A .
^p B .
The student could say how much weight he used .
Also increase the weight in the second trial .
The measures of every plastic should be the same to start .
Secondly , there should be a precise amount of weights being added .
My conclusion is that type B stretched the most .
It was easily the longest .
I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most .
Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest .
The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials .
When i get low to the ground .
How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic .
A ) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all .
Also , it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also .
2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to .
A .
^p B .
Another way to give a hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong .
The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment .
Right now , one can only guess what weight that was .
a .
The best plastic type would be A .
^p B ) These students should have conducted a third trial .
Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags .
Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length .
^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with .
One way the student could 've improved the experiment is to add another trial .
Also by using the same weight to weights .
My conclusion will be that with the added weight , the plastics stretched .
The student 's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable .
a .
Plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Is conclusion , plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less .
B .
The second thing would be to increase the number of trials .
In conclusion , plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
a . )
^p b . )
In this experiment students tested to see
A .
A ) In conclusion , my hypothesis was right .
Also there should have been more than two trials .
Two ; They could have had more than 2 trials .
Also the amount of weights you add one .
Plastic B was the most stretchable .
B .
Plastic type B stretches the most ( 22.5 ) .
For instance one plastic with no weight .
b .
^p a .
From the experiment , plastic type B came to be the most stretchable .
Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest .
Another improvement wold be more trials .
The plastics also must all be the same length .
a ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most .
A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics .
Also to say how much weight to the clamp .
a .
most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm .
Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well .
The weight was and how many clamps to use .
Also , they should 've used a control plastic to compare their results to .
One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability .
A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm .
and they could have tested more types of plastics .
Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip .
This would provide a constant to compare the results to .
According to the data , plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic .
It stretched 22mm in trial one , and 23 mm in trial 2 .
Plastic type `` '' A '' '' has the worst stretchability .
`` a . )
^P b . )
One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it .
Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals . ''
Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least .
Plastic type be was the most stretchable .
WSR
Type D stretched the same length in test one and two .
In this experiment , students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability .
a .
^p b .
The student could have included how much the weights weighed .
This would make the experiment valid when reproduced .
This is because for each trial , it stretched the most .
This adittional data will make the results clearer .
a ) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic .
Type B has the most stretchability .
One way they could have improved was to do another trial .
A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length .
Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer .
Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights .
3 .
For example , adding little heat .
The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials .
3 .
^p B ) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging .
Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
a ) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials .
Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right .
In conclusion , it can be said that plastic .
Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used .
The order is from most shotely to least B D C A .
^p b ) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific .
Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights . ''
This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average .
I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant .
He could have added more that 's .
He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate .
Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two .
The results werent valid .
Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A .
A .
^P B .
This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use .
a .
Plastic B was the most stretchy .
The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials .
^p b .
The students could have improved the experimental design !
They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights .
This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials .
One way this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents .
For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same .
thing this
^P Measure the height of the table , weigh the weights .
Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm .
^p Improve : ( 1 ) .
^p ( 3 ) Add another 3 trials with different weight .
A ) In conclusion plastic type
a ) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest .
It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others .
The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial .
This always verifies the validity of an experiment .
I can not draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table .
They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh .
They also should have included the size of the plastic samples .
a .
Based on the student data , plastic type B stretched the most .
Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm .
^p b .
The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add .
The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types .
The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results .
Plastic A is the least strechable .
Comparing it to the others , it streched the furthest .
They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity .
Three trials can help make this definite .
The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic .
and to improve , the validity they should have done a third trial .
Another thing the student can do is add one more trial .
In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type .
In trial 1 22mm , and trial 2 23mm .
3 .
A .
^p B .
The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by ; 1 .
Doing more trials to collect more data .
2 .
Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min .
Also , the student could have named the type of plastics .
Based on the students data , plastic B stretches more than the other plastics .
The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B .
Because maybe the put or did different procesure .
But experiment D have the same type of stretching .
The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times .
The need to have all the materials and put it in order .
The need to have his own question .
Find his conclusion .
For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A .
Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched .
^p B ) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs .
They could have also add more trials to improve their design .
This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains .
This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately .
Also , the trial should be performed more than 2 times .
^p b .
NSR
A .
^p B .
a . )
^p b . )
a .
^p b .
`` a .
Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length .
Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch .
b .
In conclusion .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy .
They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic . ''
Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least .
^p They should have had a control , atrial where no weights were added .
A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic .
Also , that plastic A was the least stretchy .
Right now there is no constant in the experiment .
In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12 .
What is your control .
In both trials , this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest .
In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm .
Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics .
Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest .
A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second .
This way the averages would be closer to what they should be .
The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights .
2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results .
I do not , however , believe these results are valid .
Also having the same measurement size for each plastic .
The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes .
a .
^P b .
^P 1 .
The length of the plastics need to be kept constant .
^P More trials need to be done , at the minimal , three .
The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched .
A .
Plastic A stretched the least .
Also they should have included another trial .
a ) Plastic B stretches the most .
a . )
They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant .
a ) .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable .
^p b ) .
The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added .
In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Also plastic type A has the least stretchability .
The student could have had another trial .
Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial .
One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic .
If the sizes vary , the data found is useless .
Uncomparable .
Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials .
I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Also , a control group could be added .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment .
Also , they should 've made sure they used the same weights .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2 .
Also , to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four .
Having all plastic pieces be the same length .

Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic .
Also , the students should have specified the weight being used .
Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23 .
^p B ) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are .
^p 1 ) Do it again .
^p 2 ) Compare their results with another group .
I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more .
( We did n't know the weight of them ) .
They could have also repeated the trials .
a . )
^p 2 . )
The ammount of added weight should be specified .
The independent variable is the type of plastic .
By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better .
a . )
The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics .
^p B . )
What were the weight of the weights that were used .
How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights .
The student also could have been more specific in their procedure .
One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3 .
a ) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm .
b ) The student could have had another trial to test validity .
And also have started out with the same length for every plastic .
A .
Plastic type 'D ' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested .
^p B .
Conclusion ; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C .
They also should named a common value for all the weights .
a .
^p b .
The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics .
The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed .
^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2 .
Plastic type D is the most durable .
It had the most amount stretched .
My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others .
The plastics should be a set length .
Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure .
a .
Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics .
Therefore plastic type B is the weakest .
Also , they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate .
Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm .
They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length .
a .
^p b .
Plastic type B stretched the most of all .
They should have specified the mass of the weights used .
Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability .
Also , to get better results the student should 've conducted a third trial .
a . )
Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2 .
^p b . )
One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic .
A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less .
This will give him more control over the experiment .
The control should be either stretchable or very durable .
In conclusion , plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial .
Considering the plastic was already stretched .
It was n't as strong as it should of been on the second trial .
The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched .
He could of also told how heavy the weights were .
Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more .
In conclusion trial any
Although the groups results are not valid .
The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial .
They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed .
Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic .
It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics .
Different weights would affect accuracy negatively .
The student could make sure each test was in same environment .
a ) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest .
^P B ) More trials .
^P Add another type of plastic .
Another way that it could 've been improved was to do more trials .
B . )
This way it will have more time to stretch . ''
This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same .
More trials can show a trend in the data while only two ca n't .
Based on the students data , plastic type B is the stretchiest .
Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using .
The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest .
^p How much weight to rise .
^p Did a third trial .
Also , the measure of the weights were n't specified .
a .
The length of the plastic samples should also be the same .
A .
Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials .
Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials .
Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
This is because the results are inconsistant .
In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm .
Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials .
^p 1 .
How much weight was added .
2 .
What do they measure length in .
The most flexible however , was plastic sample B .
It stretched between 22-23mm .
So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment .
Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples .
While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm .
The student could also say how much weight he was using .
This is a conclusion that can be drawn .
Also adding a control would be helpful as well .
This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment .
Then the plastic cups will stretch .
For example before 30 after 40 .
Also , plastic type A is the least flexible .
According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest .
By stating the length and type of each plastic .
The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic .
It did n't change in either trial .
According to the students data , type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest .
While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm .
making plastic b have the most stretchability .
Plastic
a ) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap .
a .
Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability ) .
Plastic A was the least stretchy .
^p b .
So 25 to make the experiment uniform .
^P b .
They could have improved validity by adding another trial . ''
Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability .
The students could have done one more trial to justify their results .
Also , they could have used a different amount of weight .
B stretched on average 22.5 mm , while the other three ranged from 10-20mm .
If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability , I would choose B .
( A ) According to the students data .
This experiment is not valid because the number of weights is n't given .
Also they could have used a control for comparison . ''
It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest .
Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most .
Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length .
He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere .
According to the students data the conclusion that plastic .
Type A stretched the most .
This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of .
^p B ) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for .
You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest .
This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point .
The student should haw used the same length plastic for each .
However , there are ways in which this experiment could be improved .
The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time .
A .
^p B .
These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid .
Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid .
Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes .
It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics .
Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics .
a .
Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time .
This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time .
a ) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics .
Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less .
Every weight they add should be the same .
Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm , 23m T2 .
To improe and compare data .
Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic .
To keep data acorte .
In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm .
a .
^p b .
The west flexible type of plastic was type B .
Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch .
However , these students need to improve their experimental design .
This would definitely improve the validity of their results .
Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2 , 20mm .
Type C streched 14mm in T1 , but in T2 strech only 13mm .
The students can add more more time for the weights to hang .
this data states that plastic B was the strongest .
Plastic type B stretches the farthest .
Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level .
Also , describe how long the plastic types were before she started her experiment .
a .
Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most .
From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch .
a .
^p b .
Should it be the same or different .
The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity .
^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics . ''
To get the total weight added would 've improved validity .
3 .
A ) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest .
^p B ) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic .
He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment .
Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most .
it stretched 2mm more in T2 .
He could have also included the weights of the weights he added .
All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount .
They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant .
The length of each plastic shows the same .
If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected .
This is how they could improve .
a .
The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic .
And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment .
Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go .
For example each could be a foot long .
A .
^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials .
Plastic type A has the worst stretchability .
Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial .
They also should have used the same amount of each plastic .
Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first .
( a ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most .
The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B .
It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm .
That shows it has the most durability for stretching .
They should have also included the time on the data table .
They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment .
For plastic type A , the amount stretched increased by one mm .
With plastic C , the results decreased by one mm .
The students could improve their results by repeating more trials .
They also did n't mention the measure the plastic be originally .
a ) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A .
Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results .
a ) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types .
-Also specified how high up the table was .
Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2 .
The student could have used more plastic .
Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy .
a ) Based on the student data , plastic B is the most stretchable .
^p b ) To improve validity/design , the student could have conducted more trials .
( A ) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched .
Plastic D is the least stretchy .
One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial .
This would ensure which plastic is the strongest .
These two things must be done to ensure validity .
Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest .
^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length .
Repeat trials again ( 3rd time ) .
Both trials it had the highest length .
It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm .
It helps the validity of the experiment .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four .
This would have made the experiment more conclusive .
^p B ) They could have done more trial and try other plastics .
They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller .
^P b . )
They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials .
a . )
^p b . )
Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm .
Based
A .
Plastic type A stretched only 12mm , therefore it stretched the least .
Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm .
He could of bad more trials , and include plastic types in his procedure .
^p B ) The student could have performed another trial .
They could be specific with how much the weights weigh .
To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data .
The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results .
The least amount stretched was plastic a .
maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes .
Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics .
The most stretchable would be plastic B .
^p b .
a .
b .
A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment .
More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes .
A ) Based on the procedure the results were not valid .
How much weight am I supposed to add .
The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most .
For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm .
^p B ) The students could have done more trials .
They also could of hard more plastics .
A . )
Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested .
Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount .
^p B . )
The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length .
Also must have had the same amount of weights applied .
a .
^P b .
a . )
^p b . )
This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors .
It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used .
The plastic type B had stretched the most .
I can also see that type A streched the least amount .
Type B though , streches the most .
This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds .
a ) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched .
a .
Based on the student 's data .
^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic .
And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used .
Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B .
The student should have done more than 2 trials .
And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag .
So we could know how much it was before it stratched .
Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial .
A . )
^p B . )
The conclusion I got for the lab is that there ca n't be one .
We do n't know the original lengths of plastic .
We only have the two lengths after they were stretched .
Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic .
A ) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic .
^p B ) 1 .
^p 2 .
a .
^p b .
1 ) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most .
According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials .
Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second .
Plastic type A was the least stretchable .
It only stretched 10-12mm .
Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability .
It stretched 22-23mm .
The two trials confirm this result .
^p B ) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1 .
Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment .
2 .
This could help determine which plastic 's better .
In trial one and as well as trial two .
Also in the table include how much each weights were added on .
As well as try half with weights and the other half with none .
From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest .
Also changing the environment could improve the experiment .
Based on the student 's data , plastic type B stretched the most .
In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm .
On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least .
In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm .
So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another .
a .
Plastic type B has the most stretching ability .
As well as plastic A having the least .
^p b .
1 .
They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps .
a .
^p b .
100 grams ) .
Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one .
Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm .
Based on the student 's data , plastic A stretched the least amount .
Plastic B stretched the most .
Different weights can cause different results .
To conclude this experiment .
I would state that plastic B stretched the most .
In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm .
Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm .
And lastly , they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment .
a ) Plastic type B is the strechiest .
^p b ) The students could have done more trials .
Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable .
In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm .
a ) .
^p b .
Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals .
The student should have done another trial and have a control group .
Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1 .
Plastic D could have be stretched .
^p b.1 .
^p 2 .
a . )
Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight .
A constant variable was not included .
The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic .
My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy .
In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23 .
The least stretchy would be plastic type A .
In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12 .
The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement .
Plastic B can stretch the most .
They could 've said the weight of the weights are used .
The student should have told , how heavy the weights were .
Nor .
This would make the experiment more valid .
They also could have done another trial for more accurate results .
We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest .
They could have said how long the plastic was when they started .
They could have put the names of the types of plastics .
A .
This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable .
^P b .
They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial .
Both would help improve the accuracy of the results .
A ) Based on the data , plastic B was the most strethible plastic .
This is because , on average , it stretched 22.5mm in length .
They also could 've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics .
One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability .
And state how much weight is being added to the plastic .
Ex : kitchen wrap , grocery bag , cooking wrap etc .
They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap .
And at last have more trials .
Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials .
I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most .
It could hold the most weight , without stretching .
That will improve the results . ''
Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm .
Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
They could have said how much were n't they used .
They finally could have said what the starting length should be .
^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one .
For example a graph chart .
a . )
They could have repeated the experiment more , to validate their results .
More trials would have increased the validity .
Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least .
Followed by B , D , C .
Plastic A stretched the most with two mm .
One way they could improve it is to test it more times .
a .
Also to have the same weights of each plastic .
In order to increase the validity of the experiment .
Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four .
The student could have done more trials .
They could of also tell us a specific weight .
10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm .
The student 's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching .
One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials .
Another way is add control to the experiment .
I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic .
The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer .
This means it has more elasticity than the others .
This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers .
^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials .
That would make the hypothesis more true .
shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp .
a .
^p b .
Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials .
Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials .
Another would be to make the procedure more understandable .
Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33 .
it stretched 12mm without breaking .
Also , they should have included before and after length in their design table .
Each plastic should be the same length .
Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic .
a .
^p b .
Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability .
A .
Plastic type A is stronger than the rest .
^P B .
A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength .
Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm .
^p b .
1 ) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length .
Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics .
These students could have improved in a lot of things .
First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design .
They could have also added more trials to get a better result .
Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B .
To know that all the plastics were the same length .
a .
Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants .
a .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average of 22.5mm of stretchability .
^p The student could have specified the weight to add .
Lastly , plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm .
However , these results are not valid .
They should 've also done more trials on the other types of wrap .
^p b .
A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most .
In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A .
It changed by 2mm .
The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to .
Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on .
A .
In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial .
^p B .
Could have had 3 trials .
Also could have under control .
a .
Plastic Type B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least .
^p b . )
The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times .
He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic .
Type B stretched the most at 23 mm .
Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm .
Type A only stretched 12 mm .
There are many ways that the group could have improved their design .
One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic .
Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps .
This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results .
Based on the students data , plastic type D has the most sretchability .
They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane .
a .
b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct .
This polymer investigating lacks numerical data .
I can lab make a solid conclusion .
The student did a good job conducting this experiment .
Type D made no change , it streched the same amount for both trials .
Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were .
Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2 .
Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2 .
Lastly , plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2 .
This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable .
One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails .
Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m .
After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm .
The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B .
A .
The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm .
^p B .
Also they should do another trial and then average out the results .
The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A .
None of the other plastics had stretched as much .
a .
Well as we see on
Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic .
Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm , plastic type B is the least change .
a . )
^p b . )
A .
^p B .
1 .
If they were n't all the same size the results would be inaccurate .
2 .
In conclusion , plastic type B had stretched the farthest .
The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis .
Therefore we could see how much it 's stretched .
With the data recorded .
Overall plastic A is the most durable .
Plastic B was the weakest in both tests .
They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data .
They could have added more weight in the second trial .
Plastic type B stretched 22mm , then 23mm the second time .
Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second .
Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times .
( b ) .
They should have specified the amount of weight .
They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic .
a .
^p b .
A ) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid .
This student only had two trials instead of three .
Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm .
Plastic type C and D are in the midle .
Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic .
Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic .
Based on the students data results , plastic type D stretched the most .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
Also they should of used the same amount of weights .
Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials .
They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched .
^P 1 .
There is no control in the starting length of the plastics .
Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results .
^P 2 .
The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant .
A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Also if one made all the plastics the same length .
One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable .
`` a .
^P b .
Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2 .
Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2 .
Hence , the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics .
Instead , you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia .
They both rely on eating just one thing , bamboo or eucalyptus leaves exclusively .
They are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything .
So they have to stay in specific habitats to survive .
Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
Pandas are specialist , meaning they dine on bamboo .
Koala 's do much of the same thing .
They eat only eucalyptus leaves .
Both these animals are different from pythons .
Pandas and koala 's , however , can not .
Pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in China .
The koala which lives in Australia , only eats eucalyptus leaves .
They are similar because they are both specialist animals .
For example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
They both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species .
That means that it is able to adapt to changes .
It can eat a variety of things , it can change .

Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can live many places .
This makes them a very effective invasive species , as described in the article .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' means intruding .
They are new animals that threat biodiversity .
This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems .
This could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment .
Invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area . ''
Complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species .
Most generalist species are invasive because they look for different places to live .
`` `` Invasive '' '' means a lot to this article . ''
The word invasive is crutial to understand the article .
When a new speices is introduced to an environment that animal is considered invasive .
The python is an invasive speices to the everglades .
They are not natural there and they disrupt natures balance .
These animals are usually thought of as harmful to the environment it lives in .
This pertains to the article because one point of view considers the python invasive .
Those who support this statement would consider the python invasive . ''
Pythons are invasive reptiles . ''
( Joel Achenbach ) .
Invasive species may become extinct of the introduced generalists . ''
`` The word invasive describes how dangerous reptiles are becoming , invasive through out .
Other pairs of the word were they used to leaves live .
MacInnes believes that the term invasive is unfair because `` '' they 're introduced .
I think that invasive is a passing judgment . '' ''
Others believe they are invading places like Florida were they should n't be . ''
The snakes are unwelcome unless kept in captivity . ''
In the article , invasive means something new and different taking over .
Pythons are an example of invasive species .
We worry about panda bears , what about the other animals . ''
The number of pythons are quickly and began to overtake the Everglades .
They invaded the area and altered the natural balance of it .
Species that do five things are called invasive . ''
In the artical , pythons areInvading the American South .
They begins as pets but somehows escape into the wild .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' means to intrude and perhaps disrupt .
Thus , opinions on `` '' invasive '' '' species vary . ''
Many reptiles such as snakes and lizards have invaded America .
They are killing off natural animals such as the key largo wood rat .
These foreign predators are taking root because of humans and there condessness .
America is being invaded and steps in stop it need to be taken .
The significance of the word invasive is that these reptiles are called invasive .
According to the article .
Because the another are proliferating and hunting native specie .
Populations , they are invasive .
The article says that invasive species are a threat to biodiversity .
Italso means itchanges the enviornmental chain .
`` The word invasive sums up the main idea of this article .
`` Invasive has a negative connotation .
Really , though , they are just animals trying to survive .
Invasive brings a misconstreud idea of terror to the passage . ''
Thus , the word invasive demonstrates a central conflict in the article . ''
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' had great significance in the article .
I.e Hence the term `` '' invasive . '' '' ''
Invasive is a negative connotation because invasive species are usually threats to biodiversity .
The article deals whether or not this is true of this case .
Even the term `` '' invasive species '' '' is unfair '' '' .
Therefore the word invasive is important to the understanding of the story . ''
As shown in paragraph 15 .
That 's why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment .
Biologists , however feel invasive species are major threats to biodiversity .
An invasive species is a non-native species that is introduced into an environment .
Humans have animals as pets , a large and potray source .
These pets however are sometimes dangerous .
There is a disagreement between the pandas and the biologists .
The word invasive when the tain approving bear in the article . ''
One example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the US .
This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem .
Once they went native , they did n't go back .
The word invaisive is significant to this article .
These species brought over are taking place of our own animals .
Invasive is the right word to describe these actions . ''
This is because they are not used to having pythons there .
`` The entire article is about the threat invasive species present to an environment .
Pythons are constantly seen around the Everglades but that is not their homeland .
Specialists ca n't seem to come together and agree . ''
`` Invasive is a very significant word in this article .
An example would be the python in the Everglades .
They think its a major threat to the food chain and to biodiversity .
The significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem .
Biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an unfamiliar environment .
As the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species .
The invasive species invade and are n't imbalance in ecosystems .
First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome .
Next , the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides .
Then , the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon .
Then , tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome .
The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon .
Also , the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction .
This process is repeated until a stop code is reached .
The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome .
A strand of mRNA can be translated several times .
1 .
The mRNA attaches to a ribosome , to begin protein synthesis.2 .
The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops .
After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code .
4 ) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins .
1 .
The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2 .
The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3 .
The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA , to begin protein synthesis.4 .
Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop .
1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2 .
tRNA creates codons from anticodons3 .
rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4 .
Amino acids link together and form a protein
1 .
The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2 .
Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3 .
This will continue until it reaches a stop codon .
1 .
The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2 .
tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it .
It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes .
3 .
The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4 .
The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins .
At the ribosome , the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons .
They are then held together by a peptide bond .
The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA .
Next , tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein .
The anti-codons are joined by amino acids .
A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon .
First , a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA .
The tRNA codes for an amino acid .
The first tRNA floats away , leaving the amino acid behind .
The amino acids bond .
Then the chain of amino acids is released .
A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes .
At the ribosomes tRNA attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mRNA .
This happens continuously to make proteins .
1 .
The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2 .
The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3 .
The two produce a chain of amino acids.4 .
The chain of amino acids create a protein .
The chain that is created is a protein .
1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2 .
The tRNA is released from the ribosome .
In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm .
There , a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA .
The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on .
Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis .
When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made .
The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains .
First , the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it .
The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA .
The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place .
Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair .
These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA .
2 .
4 .
For each codon , there is a complementary amino acid .
After mRNA leaves the nuclues , it goes to ribosomal RNA .
1 .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome .
Then , tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA .
First , mRNA leaves the nucleus .
Then , the mRNA enters a ribosome .
This repeats , with the amino acids joining together , eventually making a protein .
It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied .
Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome .
It attaches at the first bonding site which matches the complementary codons .
The mRNA enters the ribosome .
The starting codon is always Met .
Finally , the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA .
This signals the end of protein synthesis .
First , the mRNA goes to a ribosome .
It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome .
The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA .
This forms an amino acid .
1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2 .
When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3 .
tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand .
4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein .
During protein synethesis , the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription .
Then after it leaves the nucleus , it enters the cytoplasm .
Translation takes place in the cytoplasm .
A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins .
The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA .
When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids .
Transcription occurs here .
The mRNA is being transcribed .
Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids .
Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain .
This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain .
replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
( 2 ) The mRNA is then read by the ribosome .
After copying the DNA sequence , mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell .
The mRNA then heads to a rRNA , where synthesis can begin .
The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA .
After this process , all three RNAs have created a protein .
The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons .
These codons code for specific amino acids .
The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA , forming a protein .
1 .
A ribosome attaches to the mRNA ( rRNA ) .
Translation Occurs ; 2 .
Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3 .
Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA .
4 .
Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured .
New proteins are made .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm .
There , it attaches to a ribosome .
The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand .
The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand .
As this occurs , ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein .
1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2 .
tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3 .
rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed .
4 .
An amino acid chain forms
It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence .
mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis .
The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA .
tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA .
the protein then goes and does its job in the body .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus , it attaches to a ribosome .
The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon .
Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA .
The codon and anticodon bind , and form an amino acid .
This chain will be a protein .
The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand .
Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand .
As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome .
it then goes to the ribosomes .
The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein .
This process terminates at a stop codon .
The result is the newly created protein .
1 .
The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2 .
3 .
The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on .
4 .
1 .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2 .
The mRNA finds the ribosome.3 .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole , only sizable for it .
It then goes to the ribosome .
1 .
The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences .
The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4 .

-Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane .
2 .
Cells also use osmosis , which is diffusion but with water .
Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis .
Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane .
These help to move different things across a cell .
Osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane .
Passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane .
Assertive uses energy to move proteins acorss a cell membrane .
Diffusion , movement from high to low concentration .
Facilitated Diffusion , energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration .
Osmosis , is the movement of water through the cell membrane .
A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion .
Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient .
Another process used by cells is cellular diffusion .
Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane .
Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane .
1 .
This process requires no energy.3 .
No energy is required for this process .
One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis .
Another process is diffusion .
Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane .
This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane .
Only some substances can leave and only some may enter .
The third process is the permeability of the cell .
Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane .
Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell .
Neither of these require energy for the cell to use .
1 .
Cells can use Passive Transports , which is where there is no energy used.2 .
Cells can use Active Transports , which is where there is energy used .
Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration .
The first type of movement is called active transport .
This type of movement requires energy from the cell .
The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion .
In this type of transport the cell does not use energy .
The last process is passive transport .
This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy .
Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell .
1 .
Osmosis-water through the cell membrane2 .
Diffusion-molecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration.3 .
molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles .
These include passive/active transport , facilitated diffusion , and osmosis .
Passive transport does not require energy , but active transport does .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane .
1 .
The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane .
2 .
Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient .
An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis .
Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement .
The plasma membrane is semi-permiable .
It allows water in and out without trouble .
Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins .
These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails .
This membrane is water soluable .
1 .
Osmosis : Diffusion involving water .
The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium , and have everything balanced .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane .
Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport .
Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane .
However , endocytosis is a form of active transport .
One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP .
These substances move from high concentration to low concentration .
The protein channels allow certain things to come through .
It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration .
One process used by cells is endocytosis .
This vesicle can now travel into the cell .
Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell .
Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels .
This requires energy .
Cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane .
Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy .
A cell uses diffusion , osmosis , and transportation .
In diffusion , substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane .
Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane .
There are two types of transport : active and passive .
This process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy .
This is a typw of active transport .
Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water .
Another way is by facilitated diffusion .
This type of diffusion requires ATP .
A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis .
Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell .
This process occurs by diffusion .
1 .
This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane .
The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell .
1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2 .
Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell .
A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain .
1 .
Energy Required.2 .
Passive Transport : Used to move substances through the membrane without using energy.3 .
Osmosis : Moving water across the membrane by way of carrier protiens .
Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane .
Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this .
A passive transport uses little or no energy .
One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport .
Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane .
Diffusion is another way of transporting substances .
Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane .
Three ways to do this are active , passive , and diffusion .
Active transport requires energy , this may use transport protiens .
Passive transport does not require energy , the molecules just pass through the membrane .
Facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell .
1 .
passive transport where the need niether energy or a key
Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell .
passive transport- doesnt require energyactive transport-requires energy
This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal .
Osmosis .
The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport .
The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport .
The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient .
Diffusion is a high concentration to a low concentration .
Osmosis is diffusion only it is with water .
Facilitated diffusion is diffusion only with large molecules .
Their is active transport , passive transport , and then their is gradient transport .
Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell .
Osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane .
Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane .
The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration .
Active transport is the opposite of diffusion .
Active Transport is one of the three .
This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell .
The next process is passive transport .
This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell .
osmosis , which lets water in and out of the cell .
THe three types are diffusion , facilitated diffusion , and active transport .
Diffusion does n't use energy to move substances .
The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration .
It uses no energy because it still diffusion .
Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration .
This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow . '
Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane .
One major type of cellular movement is passive transport .
The cell can use diffusion , or osmosis if the cell is moving water .
The cell can also use active transport to move substances .
Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides .
The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis .
This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy .
Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane .
Endocytosis .
Exocytosis .
Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell .
Osmosis is similar to diffusion , but occurs with water .
Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane .
It requires no energy , so it is called anerobic .
These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy .
Cell mebranes are semi-permeable .
Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane .
Type one is passive transport .
Type two is active transport .
Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane .
Cells can also use diffusion .
Active transport requires the cell 's energy and exports things out of the membrane .
in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell .
Osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell .
The first process is possessing a passive transport .
The second process is osmosis .
This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane .
Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration .
Active transport is also used .
ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane .
ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient .
Protein carriers also control movement of substances .
Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane .
A cell 's membrane is selectively permeable .
Cells also use passive and active transport .
Passive transport requires no energy .
Some form of passive transport include osmosis , diffusion , and facilitated diffusion .
This is when the cell does not require energy to move .
Material just flow through the cells pores .
Active transport uses energy .
Passive transport does not require energy .
the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane .
Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane .
Through osmosis , water can freely pass through the membrane .
Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane .
These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane .
1 .
2 .
3.diffusion when
One movement process is called osmosis .
This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane .
Another process is called facilitated diffusion .
The third process is called diffusion .
This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane .
Passive transport does not use channel proteins , nor does it use energy .
One process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis .
Osmosis is moving water across a membrane .
Another process is using a protein channel .
The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids .
Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane .
Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy .

Look up in the sky !
The author of 'Orbiting Junk ' organizes the article into four sections .
The author organizes the article in multiple sections .
they have a section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
The first section defines 'space junk ' for the reader .
iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest .
so white
black : : The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside .
So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside .
White reflects more light than black .
So to me I think black would be the best color .
Therefore , a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse .
And in `` '' Air Temperature '' '' the average temp .
white : : White would keep the dog house cooler .
White does attract heat like the color black does .
white : : It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse .
white : : White will affect the dog house by making it cooler .
In the trials , the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as .
white : : I would paint the dog house white .
The highes t temperature was 53 ( DEG ) for the black lid .
Which would cause the dog t o overheat .
While the lowest temperature was 42 ( DEG ) for the white lid .
Which would help the dog stay cool .
Therefore , a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray .
black : : The doghouse will be warmer .
black : : the color black heats the doghouse the most .
so black would be the best colo r
Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me .
white : : The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature .
white : : White .
white : : White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse .
white : : White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat .
white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite .
This is because white does n't attract as much heat .
Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot .
I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler .
white : : the dog house will not be to hot .
in the jar the lea st
Therefore , light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse .
black : : I think black would be the best color for the doghouse .
There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white .
The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) .
temp. , and for the white lid the ave. temp .
was 42 ( DEG ) C. controlled varible : temp .
in jar before starting exp .
responding : air temp .
inside jar after 10 min .
uder lamp manipulated : lid color
In the experiment , lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature .
This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy .
Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors .
That is an 11 ( DEG ) difference .
So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white .
example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black .
This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating .
th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( DEG ) C
White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible .
white : : The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler .
white : : in the experament the color white absorbed less heat .
white : : This color will cool down the dog house .
The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar .
black : : Black will make the doghouse to hot .
you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer .
The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool .
On hot days the dog would stay cool .
Black was an average of 53 , and Light gray was 45 .
So its a just right roof .
if they used the white the dog house would be too cold .
the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog .
This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot .
In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black .
Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius .
White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day .
light gray : : Light Gray .
Because the color is not that dar k , but not that light ether .
This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse .
white : : White is the best color to use for the doghou se .
white : : It would make it cooler than the other colors .
white : : White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse .
black : : The black paint would absorb heat .
That would keep the doghouse warm .
white : : White is a very light color .
But with black i t attracts the sun .
so inside this doghouse when black , it can get hot .
black : : this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer .
12 degree difference !
That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white .
white : : White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors .
black : : This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer .
Dark colors absorb more heat energy .
In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest .
This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter .
In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
white : : white reflect the light .
So its fairly compfortable for a dog .
the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar .
this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp .
However the lid was also a bit warm .
White would be the best choice for the doghouse .
The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees .
which is super hot .
Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees .
white : : The paint color that they should use is white .
example : the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar .
white : : white will , attract less heat .
black : : The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse .
So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite .
white : : The best color for the dog house is white .
white : : I would choose to paint the dog house white .
This has an overwhelming difference of 11 ( DEG ) C after JUST 10 minutes
Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better .
With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold .
white : : It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature .
So if the roof is white the dog will too cool .
the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse .
and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest .
the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
at 42 degrees celsius
-
the diffentcies would be 11 ( DEG ) .
white : : It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer .
The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black .
Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse .
white : : Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler .
the paint had the lowest temp .
of air in the lab as white does n't attract heat like black does
The ligh ter the color , the cooler it will be inside .
Light gray was in the mid dle of the data .
And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot .
white : : The best paint color for the doghouse is white .
The dog would n't want a hot sweaty dog house .
Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer .
white : : The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way .
The color white dos n't absorb as much heat as the other colors do .
Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse .
According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside .
Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house .
white : : I chose the color white for the doghouse .
All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways .
Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse .
white : : The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool .
white : : The color white is the best choice .
It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture .
This is proven by the data gathered by the trials .
It really depends on where t he people live and on the season .
The temperature used for explanation w as the average .
Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot .
The average for the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) c for black .
black : : Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse .
This proves that black absor bs the most heat .
Therefore , black is the better color to paint the doghouse .
dark gray : : I would use dark gray .
The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer .
Dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) .
Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature .
white : : It Was The Coolest With the Temp .
is 53 ( DEG ) c if the dog likes it hot in there
white : : Darker colors usually attract more light .
By attracting more light , it usually makes things much warmer .
As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature .
white : : The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re .
This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm .
That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house .
So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint .
black : : Black absorbs light .
in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color .
Get it rig ht .
I sugest painting the dog house white .
The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial .
white : : the white had the lowest temp .
white : : The lighter the color , the less air temperature .
The darker the color , the more heat .
So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse .
Dark gray has trials that are 48 ( DEG ) C which is hot .
So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house .
In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius .
For the lowest color , white , it was 42 degrees celcius .
Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse .
and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees .
a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm .
I t hought it might be too hot for the dog .
As for white is would get the least amount of heat .
black : : Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black .
That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight .
dark gray : : This color would keep the temperature just ri ght .
It would n't be too hot or to too cold .
white was on averge 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than black .
Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42 .
This is proven because in each trial , white had the lowest temperature .
Dogs do not normally enjoy hot , stuffy enviornments .
They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated , and get very uncomfortable .
So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color .
black : : The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter .
The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors .
White would not be as warm as black is .
The darker the color of something , the more heat the object absorbs .
I w ould paint the doghouse white .
white : : the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside .
This way , the dogh ouse would be around 48 ( DEG ) .
That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
However , you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed .
If placed indoors , the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm .
The black lid absorbed 11 ( DEG ) more heat than the white lid .
black : : the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy .
So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white .
Their hypothesis was correct .
white : : The best paint color for the doghouse would be white .
Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature .
In Summer , you would n't wan t the dog house to be over-heated .
white : : White could be a color for the doghouse .
White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees .
It would n't be to hot or to cold for the dog .
white : : white would make the dog house less hot .
As shown in the data white is the coolest .
The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog .
However , on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable .
The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat .
The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest .
If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties .
If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties .
If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties .
If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties .
