first off they could have been more specific in their experimental design
the two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis
she is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school even though she is exhasuted
he knows where leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either
he seperates it into different sectoins such as what is spacr junk
so paul asked him what happened after that
when mr leonard came along and helped boost his confidence
you would need a scale to measure the different containers
he is certainly grateful for mr leonards kindness but fails to see mr leonards motives
no matter the size of the debris the speed can cause serious damage
it stretched mm in trial one and mm in trialone
in the introduction it catctes the readers atention by using shocking statements
paul cant read and neither could mr leonard
they need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container
in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that wasnt involved that is needed
the author organize the article by brecking it down into peices
the trna then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the trna
the author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first
based on the students data plastic a stretched the least amount
knowing his past could have also given paul a reason to excel in track
chinas panda and australias koala are different from a python because pythons eat other animals
one trait that can describe rose is that she is comforting
this section tells the reader in detail or how dangerous space junk can be
in paragraph one the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things
the difference bettween koalas and pandas is pythons eat meet and above any kind
paul could relate to what mr leonard went through
equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
furthermore i need to know the amount of each sample needed
if those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated
osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane
the effect that has on paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards mr leonard
the trna then builds up into amino acids that link together to become a protein
other than this the experiment was written decently
the student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable
c and mm and d mm were in between
the coach wanted paul to excel at something since he could not read
after that nobody wanted a runner that could not read
pandas and koalas are similar because they do not favor change a basically eat one food a day
rose cares for her family not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt
the author organizes this article orbiting junk into specific sections
the movement of water across a selectively permeable membraneactive transport
you would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant
crash course and little bits but a big deal
these specialists species are different from pythons which are generalists because they can not survive anywhere in the world
no college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read
in trial the amount stretched was mm
after reading the procedure there were things missing
paul realizes that mr leonard has trouble reading just like him
it made him respect mrleonard even more becasue they were alike
to improve this experiment the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic
a in conclusion my hypothesis was right
in conclusion to this data i think plastic type b is the most flexible type of plastic
a control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment
he could of bad more trials and include plastic types in his procedure
how much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample
based on her conversation with aunt kolab the reader can tell that rose is a caring person
the just use thing they know and but things where they belong
this is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close
it will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite
he didnt know that mr leonard was a track star
they basically have the same issuses in their lifes
he sees that even though mr leonard cant read he still had a great accomplishement
this boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes paul want to achieve goals
in order to replicate the experiment i will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers
i would also need to know what sample goes in each container
when mr leonard explains as to why paul was attentive and sympathetic
line in the soviet union launched th efirst artificial satellite
they differ from pythons because pythons eat rats and other animals
in the story it says this man had given his time to help me excel at something
rose reasures her that once paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college
she is so worried about helping her brother go to college
also if one made all the plastics the same length
at the ribosome the trna comes and matchs the codons with anticodons
next he explains to us just exactly what space junk is and how it gets there
mr leonard tells paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read
the effect on the backround information on paul seemed like they made them very similair in a way
pandas in china and koalas in australia are both specialists while pythons are generalists
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialist animals
the information paul learns inspires him
and this section has paragraphs specifically talking about space junk
they should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control
finally he talks about the importance of keeping space clean
also for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used
the second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis
if you can achieve a goal you can do anything
one way they could improve it is to test it more times
it also explains why mr leonard did get suspicious about paul leaving class early
the background informations effect on paul is that it inspires him
we would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying
he begins by using an introduction that will get the attention of the reader
the author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better
they knew how each other felt not knowing how to read
coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house
the author organizes his articles into sections
make a control having the clamp without weight be measured
she decides to tell her aunt of this dream
the ribosome then attaches trna to the corresponding nucleotide sequences
he was shut out because he couldnt read
for example the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to mr leonard
but after he explained about hies past to paul
you would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results
while pandas eats bamboo koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
also i can conclude that plastic b stretched the most because it held the most weight
one piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in
a in conclusion plastic b had the most stretchability
it encourages him to excel in both school and sports
the group will need to put to the following information
also he feels that he can compensate for mr leonards training by teaching him to read
i would need to know what were the four different samples
the author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories
the author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections
when he asks mr leonard what happened after that
selective permeability is a process that allows certain things in the cell and keeps certain things out
all the other sections follow a similar suit
he related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud
plastic type b stretched the furthest with mm on t and mm on t
and plastic type a stretching the shortest with t at mm and t at mm
the author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space
i would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
in both trials this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest
paul did not understand why mr leonard kept his college tack experience a secret
paul can feel the emotions that mr leonard is feeling
this shows how she cares about her sister
he then sets a historical background and defines the term space junk
the students could have been specific on the weight of the weights
the group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using
also in the experiment white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors
koalas and pandas are both specialist species
pythons would try to eat other animals that what makes them different
also they should have included another trial
third you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal
the plasma membrane is selectivly permeable
a trait i can identify from roses conversations is that she cares about people in her famil
one trait that describes rose is respectful
and specify the size and type of the containers used beakers
it would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be
the students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic
see both paul and mr leonard cant read
what temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying
paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability
then he lets you know how much space junk is in space like satellites
the color white dosnt absorb as much heat as the other colors do
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation with aunt kolab is caring
to get the total weight added wouldve improved validity
an example is its only been four months rose said as gently as she could
the author begins the article with a catchy indtroduction
i think that paul noticed how great of person he was
one trait that is shown is how she is caring
because mr leonard flunked he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed
paul is shocked that mr leonard didnt mention the fact that he was a college track star
heshe does this by using exclamation and question marks
the darker the color of something the more heat the object absorbs
the group could have also included information about the vinegars temp which is an important constant
the author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories
do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple
the author organizes the article by putting a title on each different matter that they are addressing
they are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and do not require a specific type of food
it is evident that polymer d had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials
there are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment
in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm
in order to replicate the groups experiment i would need a lot of additional information
paul suddenly realizes why this janitor was helping him out so much
i also need to know how much vinegar is needed
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
plastic b stretched mm and plastic d was impervous to the weight and didnt change
active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain
mr leonard couldnt read and he wanted to make something of himself just like paul
his introduction catches the readers eye and provokes him to want to continue reading
students can improve the design by having a control so that they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable
lastly i would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer
we see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with anna
this background information helps paul realize why mr leonard was helping him out
the first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is
every week paul passes mr leonard a hall monitor on his way to remediation
we worry about panda bears what about the other animals
the information that paul gets helps him understand why mr leonard was sympathetic for him
the author started off by telling us what space junk is then went into the different catergories
he says that he knew mr leonards feelings well because he had often felt them
rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father
mr leonard then says he wasnt a good student and his running career was ended because of it
secondly in step two i need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers
white i chose the color white for the doghouse
the author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled what is space junk
the first part of the artice he uses the word space junk
the author then gives background information of how the space junk got into orbit
b the student could have had another trial to test validity
we would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step
the articel being organized helps the reader stay interested and understand better
it should also tell the size and or type of containers used in this experiment
osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semipermiable membrane and doesnt require any energy
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it fits through the holes by virtue of being singlestranded
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
the backgroung information that paul learns about mr leonard makes paul feel better about himself
you would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure
to replicate the experiment the procedure would require more detail
paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading
next you would need to know how much vinegar you need to put in each container
i would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the hours
animals call this reptiles invasive because they are a nonnative species and are essentially invading our country
are the different containers made of the same material
the author organizes the article with subtitles
one thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container
white the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature
crash course describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut
she tells anna we have our part to do to help paul finish college
the additional information i would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample
the word invasive means to intrude and perhaps disrupt
this always verifies the validity of an experiment
thats because paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done
plastic type b was least strongest because it went down the most
paragraph states the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
the least amount stretched was plastic a
the term invasive is just saying how the animals forced out and go to new places and live there
this is why at the end of the story paul decides to help teach mr leonard how to read
it seems like hes been gone for years para
we dont know the original lengths of plastic
during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard
the word invasive had great significance in the article
as long as a python is hungry enough it will clearly resort to any food source
assuring we have our part to do to help paul finish college
and also that mr leonard was a track star
i dont know if they need to stay at room temp cold or not
white using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint
in the story states that paul took his free time to print out a paper about mr leonard
based on the data plastics type a stretched the least
then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this space junk can be
then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk
he found out that he was a former track star who broke records in college as a freshman
paul is empathetic towards mr leonard and viceversa because of their similarites
conclusion the stretchiest plastic was type b
the water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water without using energy
i think this affected paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher
the student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic
the result is the newly created protein
a quantity of vinegar needs to be specified as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia they both eat one common food
the author separates the article into four sections
to replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container
he organizes this article by first talking about what space junk is
pandas in china are both similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists
whereas pythons have a much larger diet and con eat almost anything
the word invasive is used to describe the reptile species being invaded into america
then they talk about the satellite collision between the americans satellite and the russians satellite
lastly i must know where the containers were placed in the sun shade etc
crash course and little bits but a big deal
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because both specialists
also pythons can sometimes be kept as pets
in the experiment the white lid was degrees cooler then the black
the conclusion would be that type b plastic streched the most for both trial one and two
to replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup
active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell
so that it can remain constant throughout the experiment
rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister
i see this because in his results plastic b had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched
the students data shows that the plastic types are stretchable
he also seemed amazed by everything that mrleonard had done
the pieces are so little but yet so powerful
it also means that while breeding these pythons are attacking and endangering the native wildlife
in a python swallowed an alligator
if i had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment
for starters paul is somewhat astonished to find that like him mr leonard cant read
i would also need to know to record the data and take observations
a i concluded that plastic type b is the plastic with the best stretchability
or by a light source makes a difference too
you can understand this from her converstation with anna
paul feels a relation between himself and mr leonard
one trait that shows how rose is as a person is that she is very mature
this is how pandas and koalas are different from pythons
it attaches at the first bonding site which matches the complementary codons
the least stretchy would be type a stretching mm in t and in t
b check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct
these little pieces flying around this fast can destroy a satellite
pandas and koalas cant be adapting like pythons can
paul is curious as to what happened to his career as a track athlete
the author organized the article orbiting junk by adding different sections of reading
pythons are generalists they can move anywhere and adapt to their surroundings to survive
the additional information i would need is to know what size the containers should be
they quickly describe what space junk is and how it is created
the place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well
what temperature would the samples be inwould it be the same or would it be different
some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in
then the complimentary trna with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mrna strand
paul has difficulty reading as well and he was always chosen last for sports
then i would need to know what the three samples are
the first catagory what is space junk
the background information that paul got on mr leonard realated to himself
it made him confident that mr leonard could make him great
then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life
white i have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature
the author organizes it into three different sections
pandas mostly eat just bamboo and koalas generally only eat eucalyptus leaves
based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much
during the story the reader gets background information about mrleonard
also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right
paul looks up to mr leonard and paul wants to return the favor and help mr leonard
mr leonard responce was i was a good athlete but not a good student
the word invasive sums up the main idea of this article
when paul found the information about him he was surprised
they also both only eat one thing exclusively panda bambo koalas eucalyptus leaves
and black averged deg so to have a cooler dog house paint it white
therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest
paul i surprised at the information he didnt know that he had been training with a track star
because he cant read all that well but he is good at track
b one way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial
mr leonard flunked college because he could not read well
you can tell this because shes worried about her sister
the author organizes the article with facts of space junk that are in space due to space exploration
the burmese python living in the wild is now found in the us
it explains that its not going like five miles and hour but thousands
the word invasive is used to describe the reptiles many times throughout the article
diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane
how long do i rinse the sample in distilled water for
in their procedure they also should have
paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody
sections are clearly separate from one another
in the he talks about how little pieces of matter are a big deal in the atmosphere
but he also finds out that mr leonard didnt do well in school
for example the very first paragraph after the introduction has a headline that says what is space junk
these differ from pythons which are generalists and like humans more able to adapt to different environments
repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics
paul feels the same way as mr leonard does about not being a good reader
within these groups are the information in an orginised mannor
and how many trials are needed to get more accurate data
a plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic
diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
he is touched by the fact that mr leonard took his time to coach him into being better
the conclusion would be that plastic b had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least
this article is organized with a fairly common format
first i would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container
the author organizes this article very well and its easier to understand
white the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot
after this they tell you about how two satellites crashed into one another causing space debris
i believe that the author did a good job of organizing this article
he was grateful for everything so he decided to return the favor
mrleonard used to be a very successful track athlete
pandas in china care very similar to koalas in australia theyre both a species of specialist
what kind of sample of material are you using
paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star as a college freshman
in conclusion it can be said that plastic
an example of this trait can be seen when she asks anna if she is alright
knowing this information it had a great effect on paul
one way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials
these things are all very important information that wasnt included
next trna comes along and attaches its anticodons to the mrnas codons
the titles of the section and article orbiting junk what is space junk
paul discovers that mr leonard was a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at natuionals
crash cource and little bits bit a big deal
black if they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm
the author has separated these things into three sections
lastly you may need to know that the samples are marble limestone wood and plastic
paul discovers some information about mr leonard when he is given the url for the track and field website
one piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar
one trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring
the author organizes the article by different concerns
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because their both specialists animals
in the second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk
the way that pandas are similar to koalas is that they both only rely on one food source
paul finds out the mr leonard was a track star in his running days
during roses conversation with her aunt the passage says rose didnt answer
determined she sticks to what is important to her
the students need to include what the samples were
paul only knew mr leonard as the hall monitor at his school
paul had then started training with mrleonard
based on the students data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type b stretched the farthest amount
this group needs to include quantitative information such as how much vinegar
they should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect
out of all the plastic plastic a is the stretchiest
then the author explains what exactly is space junk and how it is formed
the space junk title is starting of by saying there is actually space junk
rose can be optimisticrose kept nodding
also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for minutes
second you need a control for comparison purposes
pythons are capable of eating a bigger diversity and pythons often do best in and around human
the author uses cause and effect to organize the article
also the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic
this way we have more information to base our conclusion off of
he finds out they both has the same weaknesses
if there is one sample that is shorter than the others the results will not be accurate
the student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh
the last little article tells the reader how small but still very dangerous the space junk is
and that after he was a drop out no other collage wanted him
mr leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasnt a good student
first a trna attaches to the strand of mrna
the author organizes this article by breaking it up into four parts
for example pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves
pandas in china in australia are similar because they are both specialist species
hes more interested in why mr lenoard never told him about it before
in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk
in the first trial it stretched mm and in the second mm
he just wants the reader to want to keep reading keep it intersenting
polymer a stretched the least and polymer b stretched the most
then he states some startling statistics to explain how dangerous spage junk really is
this is because its not supposed to live their and therefore altars the balance of the ecosystem
in the second paragraph the author defines space junk and uses the history of space junk
he makes the topics seperated like this to look almost like a newspapper and to show each is important
koalas and pandas are both specialist animals that only eat a cenant type of plant
you can also conclude that plastic b has greatest stretchability
how tiny debris can be a big deal and cause a mission to fail
black absorbed an average of and white was only
first knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space
soon ending is essay with a persitant conclusion about how the space agencies can find a more efficent way
plastic type a has the worst stretchability
the author organizes the article like this to make the reader understand without getting confused
plastic type b stretched the most having stretched then mm
the third section descirbes a specific event that led to space junk
a plastic b has most crosslinking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest
the pandas eat bamboo and the koala bear eats only eucalyptus leaves
after reading the groups procedure there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment
this step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain
but the difference paul had a reading program to go and mr leonard didnt
the dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable
type a had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type b had the weakest
paul asks why mr leonard didnt tell him when he was coaching paul
he was very organize and got his point across
before all the information can bore the reader the author changes the topic to crash course
they area both different from pythons generalist species who can eat a lot of different animals
pythons are constantly seen around the everglades but that is not their homeland
this is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains
they dont state how they find the mass of each sample
they also could have included record results in their procedure
it talks about space debree and how to solve the problem
rose can be described by the the word caring
i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment
white does attract heat like the color black does
she assured her that her father was doing the right thing by working in los angeles
white the best color to paint the dog house would b e white
paul learns that mr leonard use to be a really good runner but was bad at reading
leonard was a college freshman who won the meter dash and broke records
a strand of mrna can be translated several times
if she didnt she would have ignored anna and got on her paper
the author organizes the article into sections
too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically
i would also need to know what type of containers to use
that way t he dog would not be so hot in its house
they are similar because they both only eat one thing and they are specialists
for example add pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes
some of the titles are what is space junk
sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested
white it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there
in order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included
material type a stretched the least and material type b stretched the most
the effect that the background information had on paul was shock
my conclusion will be that with the added weight the plastics stretched
finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is
white i chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature
the author organizes the article with specific titles for each section
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both eat leaves and plants
the dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black
another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to
it stretched on average mm while the others did not stretch past mm
then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container
mr leonard said i looked good back then didnt i
the author writes about what heshe will be explaining
by putting the articles in there owns subject like what is space junk
being sent into space and how therefore space trash is increasing
paul learns that mr leonard is both a track star and a poor reader
another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same
to organize the article the author breaks up the information into different categories
and to improve the validity they should have done a third trial
so he feels empathy for mr leonard and decides to help him
they are then held together by a peptide bond
paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college
i can conclude that on average plastic b was the most stretchy plastic
there is also no indication when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples
an improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching
all of the bags stretched only around to mm difference in both trials compared to their first
from the section orbiting junk he uses excitment for his tone of vioce
the author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article
also the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container
the background infortmation effects paul because it makes him want to work harder
more trials can show a trend in the data while only two cant
in conclusion plastic type b has the most stretchability
next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it
rose is thinking of how shes going to get to college when her family has no money
finally you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the hours
he learned that he had to be determined no matter how discouraging the lack of reading skills truly is
black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better
she loves her sister very much and you can see that by what questions she asked anna
this differs from a python because they eat meat can possibly hurt someone
because the temperature and sunlights does changes the result
pythons and other animals were imported into the states and have been kept as pets
one of the subheadings is what is space junk
he wants to do something nice for mr leonard just like he did for him
they are both very good at track and neither of them can read
also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like mr leonard
so paul decides to offer his help and teach mr leonard how to read
that rose is a thoughtful girl because she wouldnt tell her aunt something that would hurt her
rose also has school work and family obligations that she has to take care of too
based on this students results i can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type b
you need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers
in protein synthesis after the mrna leaves the nucleus it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm
a from the students data table i came to a conclusion that plastic b is more stretchable
that is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight
the author separates his different information into groups by content
it helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read
paul had experienced some of the same things that mr leonard described from college
these two animals differ from pythons because pythons are generalists
then talks about crash couses that has happened out in space and the materials is still out there
the author organized this article by making every section have a diferent topic
pandas in china only eat bamboo which is only found in certain asian countrys
