It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard did n't seem happy about seeing the printout .
The next section 'What is Space Junk ? '
First , mRNA leaves the nucleus .
In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type .
They break it into sections , which allows the reading to get a better understaning .
Like in the article ' what is space junk ? '
Rose doesnt want to tell her aunt the truth because it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her mother .
In the story Crossing Over , the character Rose is very hard working .
^p B ) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side .
Also , Paul can sympatize with Mr. Leonard , which will make their relationship stronger .
Pythons can adapt to many different environment and eat a variety of foods .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they 're both speciaslists .
Pandas only eat bamboo , and koalas bears feed to only eat leaves he stated in paragraph 21 .
Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too ca n't read .
The procedure does not state what the samples are .
After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day ?
The background information has a significant effect on Paul .
Both the Chinese pandas and Australia koalas are specialists .
^p 3 .
But just like Paul Mr. Leonard can not read .
I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
In the story Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard .
It shows that Rose a mature and understanding person , partly because she feels obligated to .
You broke records . '
To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing .
Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator .
In the fourth and fifth paragraph he is telling information about what has been sent to Earths atmosphere .
The auther orabizes the article in sections .
then explaining what he was going to talk about 'space junk ' .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container .
A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most .
Now , they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision .
Those tiny fragments in space traveling at 5 miles per second can destroy a space shuttle .

The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error .
No nother school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion .
Both would help improve the accuracy of the results .
Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and did n't change/ .
The author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title .
This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read .
Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type .
I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers .
I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching .
Paul first learns that Mr. Leonard won the four hundred meter hurdles at nationals and broke records .
B ) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy .
Paul refers to this because he ca n't read either .
They have chosen one main point , which is space junk , and created a few subtopics .
They could have said how long the plastic was when they started .
As shown by the data , plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most .
`` These invasive species are considered invasive because they were n't supposed to originally be here .
So , Paul took that in as something that he could do .
What type of vinegar , and what time you started .
When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him .
^P b ) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic .
We need to know this as well .
Mr. Leonard is very supportive and Paul is no longer embarrased about his situation .
When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read .
I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2 .
Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard .
In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information .
I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
She 's caring towards her family memebers .
Paul soon realized that Mr. Leonard was a superb athlete , but was not the best student .
Explain what the four different samples would be .
he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like 'what is space junk '
They are new animals that threat biodiversity .
Mr. Leonard could n't read and he wanted to make something of himself , just like Paul .
Last , I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period .

because I do n't know how to read . '
Rose is thinking of how she 's going to get to college when her family has no money .
Paul looks at Mr. Leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past .
These two animals differ from pythons because pythons are generalists .
When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped .
Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt .
I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person .
light gray : : Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate .
Now Paul wants to keep running , and help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college , which seems to inspire him .
First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome .
The author organizes the article by headlines .
That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused .
white : : in the experament the color white absorbed less heat .
How much weight was added .
Crash Course .
Each plastic should be the same length .
In the light or dark ?
He continues the article by describing how space junk got into space and what it is .
The pandas consume only bamboo while koalas , eat eucalyptus leaves .
What size and configuration should the containers be ?
For example , plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1 & 2 .
This type of movement requires energy from the cell .
Finally , the last section is 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
Her family comes first in everything she does .

crashed into each other 491 mi .
Then he tells you about what Space Junk is .
Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people .
Rose seems to be a caring person .
The first section describes what space junk is , and what happens to it .
It helps organize the ideas and keeps the same subject in an area .
It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics .
you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
They both feel embarrassed because they ca n't read but like to do hurdles .
Pythons are the opposite of pandas and koalas because they are generalist .
Wha sample materials are they useing .
Some of the titles are 'What Is Space Junk ?
When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What 's wrong ? '
A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics .
^P B ) More trials .
Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent .
After reading the group procedure , the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples .
It 's a meteor ! '
`` Australian koalas and Chinese pandas seem a world apart .
He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read , just like himself .
Lastly , I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer .
According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside .
And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data .
The author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat .
Rose is very responsible , as her telling Anna about their duty helping Paul finish college shows .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat plants .
Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest .
Light gray was in the mid dle of the data .
White would not be as warm as black is .
^p 3 ) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container .
With a little training , we can do whatever .
And what are the four different samples ?
When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
Then he ends it by talking about how it can affect us .
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard .
There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment .
It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in .
One example is in paragraph two .
But , it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer .
It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story .
The author grabs your attention in the introduction .
This way the averages would be closer to what they should be .
However , on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable .
Then the author continues on with explaining how satellites become space junk in a different section .
is the foundation of the rest of the article .
Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track .
^P The student could 've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
These foreign predators are taking root because of humans and there condessness .
They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left , right or anything
By the out come of this experiment , you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest .
He or she also uses subtitles such as 'Crash Course ' to explain a few extraterrestrial crashes .
I believe that the word `` invasive '' means something like un natural and that it doesnt belong .
Then the next section explains what space junk is .
The author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage .
The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using .
She is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family .
The introduction being attention to the atricle and makes you wonder about space junk .
C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between .
Also , we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples .
Based on her conversation with Anna , Rose comes across as understanding .
They should have told us what to measure the cup with .
Plastic type B has the most stretching ability .
The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion .
`` Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists .
Anna sincerely cares about Paul and her little sister , and wants to go to college herself .
The small little things that float around can damage entire space stations .
^p B .
They can not read very well .
Plastic A only stretched 10mm ( 1st trial ) and 12mm ( 2nd trial ) .
In order to replicate the experiment , the person performing it should do a few things differently .
Therefore plastic type B is the weakest .
Each section presents a different problem contributing to the build up of space junk .
Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard .
1 .
They did not specify what type of container or how large .
1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2 .
and 'Crash Course ' .
First the writer grabs your attention with the introduction .
Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most , while plastic type A stretched the least .
I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment .
Once he finds out why , he feels a stronger connection between the two .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane .
The information Paul soon recieves from Mr. leonard has a great impact on him .
In their procedure , they also should have
It 's a meteor ! '
But pythons are animals that are harmful and that will eat a crocodile if they wanted to .
The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem .
The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way .
So look at the sky .
This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt .
This clearly shows that Rose is caring .
First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup .
Where as the python can adapt and it does not rely on only one food source . ''
Pythons are constantly seen around the Everglades but that is not their homeland .
to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about .
^p b .
Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past , he is in shock .
They both usually only eat one kind of food : bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas .
We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container .
a .
Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less .
The Article 'Orbiting Junk ' is organized in a way that is most understandable to the reader .
She did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the Aunts feelings .
was 48 ( DEG ) C , for light gray it wa s 45 ( DEG ) C ave .
Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length .
They destroy the ecosystem by either attacking other predators , eating all the food , or destroying the enviroment .
One trait that can describe Rose is respectful .
( marble , limestone , wood and plastic ) .
These differ from pythons which are generalists and like humans more able to adapt to different environments .
Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2 .
Paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46 .
They are then held together by a peptide bond .
To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
This shows that Rose is a loving person and respects others .
He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through .
We had no learning center in our school .
Pandas and koalas are specialist species .
The black lid absorbed 11 ( DEG ) more heat than the white lid .
It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did .
Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course ' .
In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he 'll be able to read .
First in the beginning two sections he describes what space junk in and how it is a problem .
The procedure does not state what the four samples they are testing .
The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient .
The effect the background information had on Paul was one of surprise .
Paul felt more of a connection after he had found out about Mr. Leonard 's struggles .
the paint had the lowest temp .
The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment .
Then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled 'What is Space Junk . '
Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike , neither of them can read very good .
You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses .
These leaves are specialists .
A .
The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose did n't answer .
Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common .
In the article , invasive means something new and different taking over .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' means to intrude and perhaps disrupt .
from this part of the story i felt that she was caring .
Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information .
In the article it says all they do is eat .
The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2 .
They also conclude that the space junk is making space missions more dangerous .
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists , while phythons are generalists .
He begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention .
More trials would have increased the validity .
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul .
' , provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly .
The author organizes this article by using different sections .
Also , it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar .
`` In the article the word `` '' invasive '' '' signifies was against the introduction of reptiles .
One detail from the story that shows this is when her sister walked in rubbing her eyes .
First they should list the samples they used .
In the section subtitled What Is Space Junk ?
Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used .
After that how little bits can make a big deal later on .
Rose seems to be very responsible .
For example `` '' a python swallowed an alligator , '' '' ''
I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers .
First , the author gives an introduction , informing the readers what the article will be about .
Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container .
If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties .
Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far .
There invasive species do n't chose to invade , but day which threatens habitats everywhere .
Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment .
Osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell .
The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42 ( DEG ) with the white lid .
The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA .
Another way is by deleting human mistake , by meaning correctly and things like that . ''
I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out .
The author sorted the article into four main sections .
Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard .
These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA .
The author organizes the artice by putting the information into three different sections .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard use to be a record breaking member of a track team .
Talking about what it is .
I would also need to know where to store the cups .
Pythons are diffrent because they are a generalist species .
Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something . '
Also , the measure of the weights were n't specified .
Paul thought that Mr. Leonard went to college , but he was wrong .
The author then supports the subtopics by details put in two to four paragraphs .
They also could 've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics .
For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm .
a ) I conclude , that Plastic type A stretched the most ( 2ml ) .
^p 2 ) They should repete the experiment more then one time .
The tRNA is released from the ribosome .
In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are .
Pythons will eat many things while pandas and koalas eat only one type of things .
According to the data , plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic .
It had the most amount stretched .
She is a compasionate and caring person that cares about others .
He then ask Mr. Leonard , 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
The author starts out trying to get your attention with what may in the sky .
His first actions are to inquire about his coach 's former accomplishments .
The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder .
But pandas and koalas can only live in china and australia due to the plants they eat .
Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm .
I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount .
I can also conclude plastic `` '' A '' '' has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm .
It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him .
The firt part , or the introduction , gives us a small anecdote on what possibly could happen .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years .
Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college .
He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records .
white : : White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer .
The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard .
Then , he defines what he is going to talk about ; space junk .
the temperatre was 42 ( DEG ) and the hight was the black at 53 ( DEG ) .
Pythons can eat any thing while pandas and koalas ca n't adapt .
The python eats many other things .
Pauls learns that Mr. Leonard could n't read , just like him .
It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm .
`` a .
Also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions .
Also , they could have used a different amount of weight .
Then , he states some startling statistics to explain how dangerous spage junk really is .
The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course . '
Second , you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers .
Some additional information you will need are the material .
Styrofoam ?
And that after he was a drop out , no other collage wanted him .
Specialists such as panda and koala can not .
This means that other animals , spreading endangered species , will not be introduced to having them there .
The author begins with statements that grap the reader 's attention and introduce the topic being addressed .
One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability .
; Crash Course ; Little Bits , But a Bing Deal '
They also did n't mention the measure the plastic be originally .
The third explains how even the littlest bit of space junk can harm satellites or other space objests .
By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible .
There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside .
Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials .
All she wants is a good life for her and her family .
Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students .
a ) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic .
In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest .
Despite how weighed down she felt , she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family .
Their only food source is where they live .
Bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and reducing sources .
He still answered Paul .
I would need to know how long to wash with water for .
Paul responds by offering Mr. Leonard 'training ' .
Rose is considerate .
To replicate the experiment , you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh .
the sample or what is being put into ?
The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup .
Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul , he returns the favor .
In both trials , this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest .
Thirdly the author explains how satellites collide in space and become 'space junk ' .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
^P More trials need to be done , at the minimal , three .
A last step should also be included to say repeat .
Four , what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours .
A ) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials .
He is also empathetic towards Mr. Leonard .
Then , how much vinegar should be added to each container .
Therefore , that is how the author organizes this article .
A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results . ''
Also it is not know how moch vinegar to use for each substance .
He wondered why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him this .
Paul onl ; y knew Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor at his school .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus , it attaches to a ribosome .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are very similar to each other in many ways .
Paul also realized that Mr Leonard and him shared the same feelings of embrassment when it came to school .
`` Pandas and koalas are both specialists .
In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic .
^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure .
Leonared , ' I said , walking back toward school .
This is a quote taken out of the passage .
In step 2 they do not say the size of the container , they just said you need them .
It then goes to the ribosome .
By doing this he shows the differnet topices .
Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic .
The author has organized the article by using headers and titles to sort the information .
Also they should have included another trial .
If they were n't all the same size the results would be inaccurate .
.
If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability , I would choose B .
Type D stretched 20 ( mm ) on the first trial and the same amount on the second .
Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2 .
In Little Bits , But a Big Deal , the author elaborates on why we should be concerned .
Rose , to me , seems to be a very hard working person .
They had a lot in common .
She works alot to help pay their way in this country .
Despite these feelings , Rose tries to remain positive for Anna 's sake , and holds her tongue .
A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere .
As stated in the article , they can almost anywhere because of their ability to adapt . ''
After the introduction , the author adds some the history involved with satellites and space junk .
light gray : : Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse .
To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2 .
This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers .
Rose seem 's very stressed , but she handle 's it very well .
As the author says , `` '' China 's panda which eats mostly but bamboo .
Rose is very compassionate and is always mindful of others .
Because Me .
The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him .
I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway .
Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student .
Without this information our data could be different .
Paul find out that Mr. Leonard was a good track runner , but not so good at reading .
They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams . ''
Rose seems very caring and always think about others .
dark gray : : This color would keep the temperature just ri ght .
They also could have done another trial for more accurate results .
'What is Space Junk ?
the samples should be kept at .
making plastic b have the most stretchability .
The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome .
And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least , meaning it 's more durable .
Although the groups results are not valid .
Translation Occurs ; 2 .
If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse .
Mr. Leonard is embarrassed for flunking out of college .
Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college .
Lastly , I would want to know the acidity of the acid ( aka ) vinegar .
He found out that he was a former track star who broke records in college as a freshman .
The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on .
no other school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
She 's making sure that Anna knows everything will be alright .
Then he has a subtitle that says 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Paul works hard and deserves his spot to work with the high school team .
In Crossing Over , it says , 'But her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter . '
Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk .
a .
A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment .
'He had to go .
But in their defining characteristics , they are very similar .
for the way she trys to take care of her sister and does alot of work for the family .
The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia whereas they can only live in certain ares .
We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup .
It also presents a solution .
^p B .
Lastly , I would also put in my procedure , how much amount of vinegar they are putting in .
She asks her what 's wrong and if she is feeling okay .
Also , it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also .
Caring .
2 .
Also , if they should all start out with the same mass or not .
All this information is needed to replicate the experiment .
'He had to go .
You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure .
I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material .
The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis , active transport and passive transport .
There should be a control included within the experiment .
Pandas and koalas are both endangered animals .
The author organizes this artcile by first grabbing attention .
The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion .
The paragraph titled 'What is Space Junk ?
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read .
I especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
He finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and Paul looks up to him for that .
He/she then adresses the problem about 'space junk ' .
When Paul recieved the background information on Mr. Leonard he saw a connection between them .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand .
The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
It makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard would spend the time to coach him .
You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours .
Mr. Leonard went through the same troubles as Paul is now .
Because of this crash their are Hundreds of millions pieces of satellite in space now .
Also , pythons do well around humans , allowing them to live as pets .
Then , they explain to the reader what space junk is and that it is dangerous .
Paul asked , 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
He wants to know more about him .
Pandas and koalas are both considered specialists whereas pythons are generalists .
The author organizes the article in different sections .
The author then gives a breif history on 'space junk ' .
He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him .
The result is the newly created protein .
black : : Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse .
Passive transport does not require energy , but active transport does .
Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials .
Finally , you 'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use .
Pandas can only eat bamboo and koala bears mostly eat eucalyptus leaves .
I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses .
She is understanding of the family 's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it .
Lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution .
After the titles the author goes into further detail under each topic title .
Second , we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers .
He realizes that after all that Mr. Leonard trained him to do he should help him in return .
When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3 .
It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type .
According to the student 's data , plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm .
By having this information , the lab will be more accurate and correct .
'Rose did n't answer .
So over all he did really well oragnizing this article .
'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
She is considerate .
Paul knew what he was talking about .
The Space Junk title is starting of by saying there is actually Space Junk .
^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials .
That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight .
In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration .
Mr. Leonard 's hidden past affects Paul by making him curious .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
The fourth section is titled , 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
respectful .
Rose is having a rough time trying to handle school , work , and everything else .
She feels bad for the way she is feeling about her familie 's situation right now .
Paul questions Mr. Leonard about college and discovers that Mr. Leonard had the same reading problems Paul has .
Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time .
The United States followed suit , and thus began the human race 's great space invasion . '
They both have essentially one type of food , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample .
They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane .
When Rose is talking to her sister , Anna she tries to look at the bright side of things .
Knowing this , Paul was releaved and was glad to help Mr. Leonard with his reading .
The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2 .
If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached .
In the introduction , the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements .
temp. , and for the white lid the ave. temp .
The subtitle 'What is Space Junk ' describes the history of space travel and how space junk is created .
She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really does n't on the inside .
Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles .
Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable .
The author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things .
One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size .
The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk .
Paul is shocked by the news , he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard .
A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis .
The author separates his different information into groups , by content .
The author organizes the article in a simple , yet structured way .
Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length .
Leonard is a role model of Paul
The author makes everything build upon each other .
One process is osmosis which controls how much water comes in and out of the cell .
More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here .
Paul realizes that you do n't have to know how to read to be good in a sport .
The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites .
You would need to know what samples you would need to use .
Both eat one type of food and stay with it unlike python that can eat anything and everytime .
They are different from a python which is a generalist and eats more than one type of food .
Next , they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves .
Paul quotes 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards wrods were all too familiar to me . '
I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well .
.
^p The student could have specified the weight to add .
They 're both good athletes who have trouble reading .
The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation .
There are two types of transport : active and passive .
Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy .
By using the same weights , we would know that the plastics are stretched fully .
He didi n't know how to read and he was only good at track .
'It 's time to start your training . ''
The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane .
a ) Plastic B has the most stretchability .
Plastic A + B stayed stretched from the T1 and then streched more in T2 .
He would help him overcome his obstacles .
Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same .
Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ?
The author organizes his article by putting a title over each section .
Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right .
The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard .
The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable .
Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school .
The python does n't eat anything that is needed .
The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics .
I can lab make a solid conclusion .
Therefore , black is the better color to paint the doghouse .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both furry mamals .
Just like Paul could n't .
' , Rose is giving Anna the hope of going to college and having a successful life .
What were the weight of the weights that were used .
that the containers were stored at for 24 hours .
The color white dos n't absorb as much heat as the other colors do .
-In step 1 , we need to know what samples .
He said he could n't read and that he flunked college because of it .
The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container .
The author also splits the text up into paragraphs that have the same idea .
Paul goes and helps Mr.Leonard as he help him .
A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability .
When her sister came into the kitchen , Rose asked what was wrong .
The background information makes Paul puzzled .
Conclusion ; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C .
Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2 .
So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside .
The author 's conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do .
The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul .
white : : White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins .
In order to replicate this experiment .
There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment .
Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment .
In the second paragraph , the author defines space junk and uses the history of space junk .
Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school .
The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers .
^p 2 ) How much vinegar should be in each cup ?
One section talks about and describes what is space junk .
The koala which lives in Australia , only eats eucalyptus leaves .
The conclusion I got for the lab is that there ca n't be one .
As a result , pythons and other generalist species thrive in this day and age .
How many items of material were put into each container .
Respect .
This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
In the first bullet , the four samples should be stated as marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
The student could have used more plastic .
A good procedure would have specified this
In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples .
Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment .
In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters .
Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him .
An invasive species is a non-native species that is introduced into an environment .
It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing .
I think that Rose is loving .
The data indicates them , but the procedure does not .
By how things happen and when they happen .
They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container .
The control should be either stretchable or very durable .
In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size .
In the conclusion section , the author wraps up the article with the main problems space junk poses
The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they both walk on legs they both eat bamboo and leaves .
white : : White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot .
The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out .
^p 3 .
These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy .
A ) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time .
While pandas eats bamboo , koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard motivates him in two ways .
Darkness ?
Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain .
the cell membrane is selectively permiable , and lets some supstances in but not others .
In order to effectively replicate this experiment .
When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship .
Finally ending with a conclusion .
You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup .
He organizes it by putting into sections of introduction , what does it do , and how it happens .
Then it provides a history of space exploration .
Maybe it wouldnt . '
Her conversation with Anna shows this .
Then he continues and talk about the section 'Crash Crouse ' .
Also , to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be .
black : : Black would be the best color , because it wou ld keep the house warmer .
They grab you attention and make you want to read the rest .
In fact he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and borke many of records .
He asks Mr. Leonard what happened and he acts concerned about it .
One way they could improve it is to test it more times .
Rose says 'It 's only been four months , He had to go .
How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I do n't know what the samples are .
Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2 .
this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp .
^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard 's past as a track star .
She is caring .
First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader .
As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane , cells use selective permeability .
A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified , as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution .
The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm .
The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A .
White does attract heat like the color black does .
The panda and koala are generalists .
The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell .
The panda can only eat bamboo and the koala can only eat eucalyptus leaves .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic .
In a way , she is responsible for her future .
He organizes it by sections , by 3 different parts .
Finally , all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier .
The author organizes this article by first introducing the topic , then explaning what the topic really is .
In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard .
In the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us .
he is surprised that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college .
white : : The best color to paint the dog house would b e white .
These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes .
Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp .
'learning center ' 'why ? '
They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment .
Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity .
It also informs readers of how scientists are trying to overcome the issue of space junk .
This information gives Paul a whole new view of Mr. Leonard .
The author puts all the main points as his title .
Pandas and koalas have very specific habitats and life cycle .
Assertive uses energy to move proteins acorss a cell membrane .
In the procedure it should say `` '' determine the mass by ... '' '' ''
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity .
The author begins the article with a kidding tone .
The author organizest the article very well .
Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples .
Finally , I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it .
Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container .
Also the article said that a python can live anywhere as a panda/koala cant .
They 're both different form pythons because pythons can eat anything and can almost survive anywhere .
Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could n't read , nobody really helped him .
^p ( b ) However , there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved .
They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up .
Rose is very sincere .
He shows this thankfulness with his desire to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read .
a .
This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl .
Also , the student could have named the type of plastics .
How much vinegar should be poured into the containers ?
The author organized the article in an explaining order .
The author begins with an introduction that grabs the reader 's attention by making a shocking statement .
You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup .
When Paul hears of the information about the hall monitor , Mr. Leonard e is shocked .
Lastly , we need to know what kind of containers ( how big ) each of them are .
They should have also included the time on the data table .
Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape .
Also , he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise .
^p b .
Line 8 : 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash ? '
In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm .
Then he explains what the 'space junk ' actually is .
Also , I do n't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup .
Invasive means a newly introduced species to the area , but it has a negative effect .
black : : If you painted the dog house black , the insid e would be hot .
The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium , and have everything balanced .
The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about .
They also should have included the size of the plastic samples .
Then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed .
White ended up about 42 ( DEG ) C while black was about 53 ( DEG ) C .
^p ( 2 ) How much vinegar to add to each sample .
The introduction has a clever beginning to draw readers in and then the rest becomes more serious .
Paul even suggests he can relate to Mr. Leonard 's embarrassment of not finishing college .
Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
And probably her aunt would tell her mother ' .
The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids .
After copying the DNA sequence , mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell .
She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister .
Pandas and koalas are very similar , they both have a strict diet .
Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house .
When Paul found the information about him he was surprised .
Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell .
This motivates Paul to work hard during school and on the track .
He tells about what is causing space junk and why .
Pandas & koalas are similar because they are both specialist species .
The space junk can 'create disastrous holes in an object moving through space . '
diffusion , which lets small proteins in and out.facilated diffusion , which lets larger proteins in and out .
How much vinegar should we put in the containers .
describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space .
The author organizes the article into several sections : the intro , 'What Is Space Junk ?
After this process , all three RNAs have created a protein .
white : : white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot .
describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from .
`` The group neglected to include what the `` '' four different samples '' '' are .
^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment ?
Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend ?
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track .
It is important to keep your constants , constant .
How much vinegar ?
Black was an average of 53 , and Light gray was 45 .
These example show that Rose is a very hard worker .
Passive transport is high to low concentration , and active transport is low to high concentration .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother .
Rose can be described by the the word caring .
Selective permeability is a process that allows certain things in the cell and keeps certain things out .
The author organize the article by brecking it down into peices .
Lastly , at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight .
The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance .
The introduction is very integuing , pulling the reader in to find out what is the problem .
Then he goes on and he describes how he was emabrassed because he could n't read too .
This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm ( 1st trial ) and 23mm ( 2nd trial ) .
And pythons can kill many different species causing problem unlike a panda or koala .
One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic .
The next section titled 'Crash Course ' , explains the affects of having free-orbiting disabled satellites flying through space .
Seeing her like that made her worried about her and asked what was wrong and if she felt alright .
All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein .
Paul knew exactly how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing how to read .
In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples .
i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
The word invasive is significant because it explains briefly what will happen when the species alters an unknown habitat .
The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it .
Do I cover the containers ?
The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment .
The impact created hundreds of pieces of debris , each assuming its own orbital path . '
Both pandas and koalas are extreme specialists .
Then talks about all the different space crafts used in the past 52 years .
And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ .
However , these students need to improve their experimental design .
But because it 's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter .
In order to replicate the experiment , additional information is needed .
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard is encouraging to Paul .
And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag .
The author first introduces the idea of space junk and the government 's concern with it .
In the converstation between Rose and Anna , a reader can depict that Rose is caring of others .
To know how much vinegar to use , 2. what is the control , if any and 3 .
She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college .
Based on the students data results , plastic type D stretched the most .
Python are a generalist species so they can adapt to places that are not ther homeland .
Paul seems very suprised that Mr leonard was a track and hurdle runner .
It is well organized in different catagories and topics .
white : : I would choose to paint the dog house white .
Rose is very considerate .
One way the validity of the results could have done more trials .
It starts with 'What Is Space Junk ? '
First , the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use .
The author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is .
It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion .
But her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter .
The author organizes this article in a very intelligent way .
^p b .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know : ^p 1 .
He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist .
a .
After asking her if she was ok she went and poured her a glass of orange juice .
They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format .
This always verifies the validity of an experiment .
This group is lacking a control group in their procedure .
Hot , warm , freezing , wet etc .
I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage .
The author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about .
Also , there should be more specific size measurements of the containar .
In the artical , pythons areInvading the American South .
^p 3 ) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples .
^p b ) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used .
In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was just like him in school ; Couldnt read .
I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul .
So , Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help .
Mr. Leonard said that he could not read either .
These animals are different from pythons because they are more adaptive .
Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School .
Not just leaving it out of their processes .
In the third paragraph , the reader talks about the risk of space junk .
Because Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt when he told him about his past .
In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
Then Crash Course which is about dead satellites craching .
You feel that she really cares for her family and does n't want to upset anyone .
Paul ca n't read just like Mr. Leonard .
They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant .
'Crash Course ' is all about collisions with satellites and other space junk that is orbiting the Earth .
This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment .
Passive Transport : Used to move substances through the membrane without using energy.3 .
They differ from pythons because pythons eat a variety of things not just one thing .
A conclusion based on the student 's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability .
The author organizes the article by makeing chapter like sections about different details .
In her conversation with Anna , Rose sees that her younger sister is upset .
The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials .
^p 2 ) The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar .
Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules , such a food into the cell .
This is proven because in each trial , white had the lowest temperature .
Paul ends up finding out the his track coach , Mr. Leonard used to be a track star .
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup .
One trait that can decribe Rose is caring .
The last paragraph is title 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
'Rose did n't answer .
Based on the student 's data , I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible .
He first gives some history on waht space junk is in the section 'What is Space Junk ? '
You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting .
Also , Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard , a difficulty reading .
Crash Course .
the embarrassment when he did n't know the answer .
As long as a python is hungry enough it will clearly resort to any food source .
They were introduced to the area and have invaded into the territory up other animals .
It will show him to never give up , and always try your best in life .
`` Invasive is a very significant word in this article .
Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it would n't .
Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most .
With more trials , the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate .
I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended .
In conclusion , plastic type B had stretched the farthest .
We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying .
He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading .
Also , the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic . ''
The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information .
Rose is optimistic about her future in life .
white : : I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house .
The author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is .
Then , he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph .
The sub-paragraphs give it away .
A . )
They list the sections in order of importance .
He broke records and got scholarships .
Also they should of used the same amount of weights .
Other than this , the experiment was written decently .
That 's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done .
She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her .
After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment .
Then he tells us how space junk is created .
The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for .
Mr. Leonard tells him , ' I was a good athlete , but not a good enough student .
This introduction makes people want to read on .
During trial 1 white was 42 ( DEG ) while black was 54 ( DEG ) .
The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be .
that is not specified .
Material type A stretched the least , and material type B stretched the most .
And so therefore Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard how to read .
Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard and make him feel better .
At the ribosome , the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data .
For long should the sample be rinsed ? ''
If there is one sample that is shorter than the others , the results will not be accurate .
Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics .
You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples .
In the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause .
It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used .
It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite .
She understands why there Papa had to leave .
At the end of Paragraph 45 it reads , 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
Rose can be optimistic'Rose kept nodding .
white : : The color white is the best choice .
One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible .
Third , you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment .
He tells of the variety as well .
They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment .
I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours .
Well I would need to know what the problem statement is .
I would also need to know what size the container should be that I 'm pouring the solutions into .
Secondly , how much vinegar should be added to each sample ?
He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades .
These opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful .
The ligh ter the color , the cooler it will be inside .
2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results .
Different amounts of vinegar would give different results .
Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell .
The author starts off by getting your attention the explaining what space junk is .
For starters , Paul is somewhat astonished to find that , like him , Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
Rose is a sympathetic person .
`` Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
The article begins with an enticing introduction .
The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment .
The introduction uses humor to convey the topic .
I w ould paint the doghouse white .
A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability .
First , how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers ?
'Crash Course , ' shows why space junk is important .
As well as plastic A having the least .
So Paul can kind of relate to this .
Rose is understanding about everything .
Because he could n't read .
He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard .
That really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph .
The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence .
Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell .
1 .
For example , the category 'Crash Course ' is a section that talks about satellites crashing into one another .
But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt .
The second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic .
The greas would need to identify
You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
The author has a very effective way of organizing the the article .
white : : White is the best color to use for the doghou se .
This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out .
The author organizes the articles by putting them in categories .
He could identify with the embarrassment he felt .
Soon ending is essay with a persitant conclusion about how the space agencies can find a more efficent way .
`` According to the results , polymer `` '' A '' '' is the strongest .
It has facts backing up they 're statements .
