He even asks Mr. Leonard why he did n't tell Paul .
The python is a generalist species , meaning that they have a larger range of adaptation .
They list the sections in order of importance .
A .
A .
The author organizes the artical into groups .
In what unit ( grams ?
One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm .
Rose asks her younger sister , Anna , what 's wrong and if she is feeling okay .
The author organizes the story with easy to navigate subtitles .
The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling .
'What is Space Junk ?
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on Paul .
The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother ' .
Based on the students data , plastic type B had more stretchability than the others .
After all , Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles .
The author organizes the article in multiple sections .
Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials .
She does this to save her aunt 's and mother 's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her .
The very last section states that even small bits of space debris can cause a big problem .
Then it provides a history of space exploration .
White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot .
It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in .
The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2 .
After that , they start with statistics that shock the reader .
There are many things she wants for herself in life .
The cause for this is to have everything more organized .
Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a track star , but he flunked out because he made bad grades .
First , you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers .
Rose is a caring person .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
The next process is passive transport .
It never states what materials to use .
Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment .
The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon .
In the procedure it should say `` '' determine the mass by ... '' '' ''
Anna could be desribed as understanding .
It kind of wraps things up .
My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others .
Osmosis-water through the cell membrane2 .
^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples .
Then he talks about how the space invasion took place .
The chain of amino acids create a protein .
The coach wanted paul to excel at something since he could not read .
black : : Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse .
Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics .
The author uses a structure of history , cause , effect , and solution to reveal information .
I sugest painting the dog house white .
Next , he uses 'Crash Course ' to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space .
The author organizes the article by putting a title on each different matter that they are addressing .
Rose is dedicated to her family .
Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane .
In the article it says pandas and koalas both eat plants .
They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane .
He does this with the heading What is Space Junk ?
White reflects more light than black .
The results werent valid .
Learning about Mr. Leonard 's past helps Paul in many ways .
Lastly , what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment .
Based on the student 's data , I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible .
In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane .
They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity .
This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it .
You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat plants .
And if it should be the same amount in all .
He wanted to know why he did not succeed in a professional level , or do anything after college .
The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees .
People do not realize what harm it could have .
One section talks about and describes what is space junk .
There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment .
After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day ?
This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister .
Passive Transport : Used to move substances through the membrane without using energy.3 .
Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration .
How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample ?
A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results . ''
passive transport- doesnt require energyactive transport-requires energy
Pandas and koala bears both live in warm climates where the plants they eat , grow .
example : the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar .
The author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past he is interested and wants to know more .
and all samples must be put in the same areas .
She tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize .
black : : Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors .
Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it 's own force while the clamps wont .
White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day .
Both of them are almost extinct .
You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change .
The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight .
the effect that Paul gets when he gets the backround information on Mr. Leonard was shcok and disbelief .
How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
He felt familiar with the feelings .
They begins as pets but somehows escape into the wild .
This is because for each trial , it stretched the most .
Both would help improve the accuracy of the results .
you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample .
Without any of the background information , none of this would have happened .
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read .
1 .
I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach .
You broke records . '
This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy .
He organizes it by putting into sections of introduction , what does it do , and how it happens .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
She 's making sure that Anna knows everything will be alright .
Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat .
Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use , and which materials .
Leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school .
black : : Black will make the doghouse to hot .
a .
Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed .
Both are mammals unlike the python which how many different food/prey and is a reptile .
A .
It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment .
Lastly , I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white , apple material .
One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment .
They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment .
Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell .
Look up in the sky !
2 ) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table .
This is shown in her conversation with both her sister Anna and Aunt Kolab .
Maybe it would n't . '
Koalas and pandas are both specialist species .
Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family .
What the samples are , what type of containers .
The next section , 'Crash Course , ' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide .
Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he does n't learn to read .
^P b . )
Finally they going into different section of how space junk is dangerous .
white : : The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way .
Animals call this reptiles invasive because they are a non-native species and are essentially invading our country .
It lets oblects in or out of the cell .
The pythons are called invasive for their destructive habits of killing off natural wildlife . ''
This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners .
Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane .
`` black : : Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy .
Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2 .
Pythons are generalists , who are n't very specific in what they eat .
Paul gets some interesting background information on Mr. Leonard .
You feel okay ? '
When paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard this effects Paul in a good way .
Look up in the sky !
The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup .
Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination .
With sections having titles , What is sapce junk , and then having information under the section titles .
Then they going on to explain what the topic of space junk is .
A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less .
As shown in the data white is the coolest .
Pandas in China eat basically only bamboo and koalas in Australia basically only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Cells also use osmosis , which is diffusion but with water .
Lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution .
One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person .
the author splits the artical up into sections each section describing different subjects .
One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment .
That she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong .
They could have put the names of the types of plastics .
( We did n't know the weight of them ) .
Then it slowly goes into crash courses and how bad it effects our atmosphere .
So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life .
After reading this procedure , I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar .
Paul even suggests he can relate to Mr. Leonard 's embarrassment of not finishing college .
Pandas in China only eat bamboo which is only found in certain Asian countrys .
' , provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly .
^p b .
There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water .
This polymer investigating lacks numerical data .
In the procedure the samples ' identities are not given .
These two animals differ from pythons because pythons are generalists .
During the story , Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a great 400 meter hurdler .
He knows he 's not the only person that ca n't read .
There , it attaches to a ribosome .
When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt , she must then do her homework .
He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him .
In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters .
With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results .
The author uses subtiles to help orginize the information in the article .
Paul is shocked when he finds out who Mr. Leonard realy is .
Finally ending with a conclusion .
The author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information .
The author finishes this article by telling the reader that space trash is on the rise .
Rose is a very optimistic person .
The greas would need to identify
Mr. Leonard could never read , yet he broke records in college .
Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college .
The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
He wants to do something nice for Mr. Leonard just like he did for him .
Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp .
He remembered what it was like to be in his position .
At the end , Paul says , 'It 's time to start your training ' ( paragraph 46 ) .
A generalist '' '' says the article are man 's pet .
They end the article with telling of the dangers of microdebris .
Paul was suprized at what Mr Leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out .
Every article has a differnet subtitle that explains a differnet subject .
Because Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt when he told him about his past .
The mRNA then heads to a rRNA , where synthesis can begin .
All these things are essential to replicating this experiment .
Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at .
Also plastic type A has the least stretchability .
^p + Efficiency ; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions .
The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul .
that is a trait of love .
Rose explains to Anna , without grief , that what they are doing is the best for the family .
How pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia is that they are both bears that eat plants .
Also , you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers .
Yet both of these animals are extremly different from a python .
The track coach and Paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great .
Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container .
Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop .
Paul can see himself through Mr. Leonard .
A trait you can see Rose has it that she is very respectful of her family .
Storing the samples , is another vital area in this experiment .
Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid .
When Mr. Leonard explains as to why , Paul was attentive and sympathetic .
In the first piece of the article , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
How much vineger do you have to pour into each container .
3.a ) In conclusion , plastic sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability .
He could of bad more trials , and include plastic types in his procedure .
One trait that describes Rose is caring .
Specialists such as panda and koala can not .
In exocytosis , vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell .
Rose is caring becuase immediatly after Anna walks in she asked Anna if she was was feeling okay .
And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot .
Different weights would affect accuracy negatively .
Furthermore , I need to know the amount of each sample needed .
Rose 's conversations with her Aunt Kolab shows that she is a caring person .
They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller .
When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article .
Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist .
Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics .
`` Koalas and pandas are similar because they are both harmless .
The problem does not state what the four different samples are .
The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he could n't read .
Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment .
I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found .
They then go into a brief descrption of 'space junk ' .
As shown by the data , plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most .
Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient .
He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either .
Australia 's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
The phrase , 'Grab your telescope !
She does n't want to hurt others so she watchs what she says and is respectful .
^p b.1 .
light gray : : The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm .
They were introduced to the area and have invaded into the territory up other animals .
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shocks him .
You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples .
By how things happen and when they happen .
The second section is titled , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
black : : If you painted the dog house black , the insid e would be hot .
Without this information , the results would be inaccurate .
He also realized they were similar .
The author also goes in chronilogical order .
covers ?
Secondly , they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results .
He began 'training ' Mr. Leonard to read well .
^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material ?
He is surprised by the janitor 's previous experiences .
Explain what the four different samples would be .
white : : If the color of the doghouse is white , this w ill keep the house cool .
I think panda and koalas was same specie .
Knowing this , Paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously .
This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average of 22.5mm of stretchability .
But her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter . '
Lastly , he concluds by proposing a sollution to this problem .
And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample .
Finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem .
The author uses titles that break the article down into smaller categories to organize the text .
He said he could n't read and that he flunked college because of it .
he didnt know that Mr. Leonard was that great of an athlete .
How should the samples be removed from the container ?
It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers .
While training with Mr. Leonard , Paul learns more about him and his past .
For example , crocodiles is something they even attempt to eat .
Then he tells you about what Space Junk is .
Lastly , the author summarizes the article and giving the reader the main idea of the article .
He was a very gifted athlete .
then explaining what he was going to talk about 'space junk ' .
This story can relate to many people .
This makes it hard for the m to survive anywhere else .
When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard , he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard .
^p B .
Each have atleast two paragraph .
The experiment can also describe the materials since the word `` '' materials '' '' can mean almost anything .
The student should haw used the same length plastic for each .
Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna .
Next he describes how these space projects have caused problems and what they are sugesting to do .
One way the validity of the results could have done more trials .
Many reptiles such as snakes and lizards have invaded America .
When an invasive species is introduced to an environment , it will complete to an indigenrous species food source .
It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk .
Also , you would need to know what type if container to use .
I believe by organizing it this way it leads to a more effective and more interesting article .
Next , under 'What is Space Junk ? '
Paul is affected by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard in many way .
In the first bullet , the four samples should be stated as marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
He organizes this article by first talking about what space junk is .
Panda 's and koalas are both specialists .
One reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them .
All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm .
by telling you what space junk is .
His attitude and the way he sees things change completely .
a ) In conclusion , the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B .
white : : It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature .
`` The data provided concludes that plastic type `` '' B '' '' stretched the most .
The day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her .
The first section defines 'space junk ' for the reader .
I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours .
Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm , which was the largest length after five minutes .
Pandas and koalas have alot more in common that meets the eye .
But not how much vinegar was put into the containers .
To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant .
The author organizes this artcile by first grabbing attention .
Clean-up is possible .
Rose is very sincere .
It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste .
Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments .
Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container .
She is hardworking .
As the tRNA attaches to the mRNA , the amino acids above them form peptide bonds .
They should also say what the sample is .
Four , what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist .
The author organizes the article in a simple , yet structured way .
However , he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college .
Pythons are different because there reptiles .
This shows the reader that tiny space fragments are a big deal and could really hurt somebody .
Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read .
Hence , the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics .
This meaning that they generally only eat one type of food , as described in paragraph 21 .
They are both different from pythons because seem toeat meat substances .
The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative .
Afterwards , the author explains that space junk can collide into one another .
The next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the Earth .
See both Paul and Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
The first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is .
Then the author continues on with explaining how satellites become space junk in a different section .
First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container .
Why ?
He could not read .
They are more like people in they way that they will eat anything that comes across there path .
The following section explains collisions involving space debris .
second , the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk .
How much vinegar you pour into the cups .
The author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space .
Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water .
The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins .
^p To improve the validity of the experiment , the students could name the four plastics used .
It really gets the point across .
And that after he was a drop out , no other collage wanted him .
They could have improved validity by adding another trial . ''
( A ) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least .
Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured .
I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf .
Each section is seperate different subjects .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both bears and have similar diets .
We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup .
White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees .
2 .
The next section is 'What is Space Junk ? ' .
Koalas and pandas are both specialist animals that only eat a cenant type of plant .
By helping him train again .
Complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species .
They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was .
Since they are natural predators , they are invading and eliminating the lives of other animals .
Lastly , information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours .
I would have to know whatknd of samples to use .
The author explains what space junk is , and how it is formed .
.
Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into .
' I lost my scholarship and flunked out , ' Mr. Leonard stated .
He says that he knew Mr. Leonard 's feelings well because he had often felt them .
We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest .
These 2 animals differ from pythons because they are considered specialists as pythons are generalists .
Then , at the end he returns him a favor by helping Mr. Leonard become a better reader .
He realized that although he could n't read either , Mr. Leonard suceeded in a way .
a ) To conclude , plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics .
In the introduction , the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements .
But her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter .
He can not read , and struggles with his homework .
They had a lot in common .
He does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact .
You feel okay ? '
The very last section seems to be the author 's main point and the purpose of her article .
Paul then deliberates that because Leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read .
In step 2 , it says , pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers .
They have actually determine the mass .
Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he could n't read also .
Specialists are different from generalist because generalist are abundant species that often do best in and around humans . ''
A .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
A ) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all .
According to the student 's data , plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types .
`` Invasive is a very significant word in this article .
He finds out Mr.Leonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm .
No matter how small the junk may be , it can still cause damage .
You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with .
It has several food sources such as the key largo wild rat or even alligators .
Why could n't they just leave it how it was .
The temperature used for explanation w as the average .
a .
The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it .
The starting codon is always Met .
^p 2 .
2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results .
Then , he found out that he had flunked out of college , because he could n't read .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2 .
The author puts Orbiting Junk in to sections to show What Is Space Junk .
Then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris .
Diffusion is another way of transporting substances .
So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse .
Lastly , i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them .
The author seperates this article into 4 sections .
On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least .
The author begins the article with a kidding tone .
Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials , which was the smallest length .
He sees that he can not read , just like Mr. Leonard .
Overall , the author organizes the article in an easy to comprehend , bit-sized manner .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' means intruding .
the information showed that Mt .
In paragraph 45 , Paul relates to Mr. Leonard 's life .
Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard .
Step one really should go at the end .
The ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem .
He wants Mr. Leonhard to do the same he did .
Also they could have used a control for comparison . ''
The next section explains to readers what space junk is .
White would not be as warm as black is .
The weight was and how many clamps to use .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists .
To replicate this , I need to know what samples I 'm working with .
I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage .
It has facts backing up they 're statements .
That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read .
Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space .
a .
They should have also told us what type of container to use .
These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails .
The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk .
In fact the comparison is nothing alike .
But pythons are animals that are harmful and that will eat a crocodile if they wanted to .
Just like any other story should start out as .
Rose is very respectful and conconcious about other 's feelings .
^p 3 ) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples .
They could have said how much were n't they used .
You feel okay ? '
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him and he wants to know why .
Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to excel in tack , and Paul will teach him how to read better .
In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling .
So Paul decides to offer his help and teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
An what type of vinegar , I would be more specific .
- he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4 .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) .
You can not replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use .
Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins .
She would do anything for her family .
dark gray : : The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm , b ut not too hot .
The space junk can 'create disastrous holes in an object moving through space . '
It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics .
It even inspires Paul to start to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
This experiment needs something to compare to or else the results are not totally valid .
Second , step 2 says , pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar .
The introduction is very integuing , pulling the reader in to find out what is the problem .
white : : the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature .
a .
Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard actually have a lot in common .
Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School .
The last process is passive transport .
He continues to ask , 'Well , what happened after that ?
He talks about what the big fuss is with the space junk and how it is increasing .
`` a .
Then he has a subtitle that says 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending reading , like himself .
Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were .
This talks about the seriousness of space junk .
Finally she challenges the reader 's integrity by asking about the seriousness of this to other people .
Paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about Mr. Leonard .
`` The generalist that are spread accidentally have seen to be `` '' invasive '' '' to that environment .
Some of the titles are 'What Is Space Junk ?
SHE DOSE N'T WANT TO HURT HER AUNT 'S FEELINGS SO SHE DOES N'T ANWSER HER AUNT .
and Crash course .
They are both different from pythons because they do n't eat meet .
He reailzed that he was in the same position as Mr. Leonard .
There , a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA .
Paul shows this in paragraph 43 .
It 's a meteor ! '
Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B , stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2 .
The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence .
The author uses the introduction to grab the readers attention .
The python however is a generalist it can live anywhere because its able to adapt to its surroundings .
Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass .
' , they quickly describe what space junk is and how it is created .
Also , to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be .
white : : white will , attract less heat .
Is there only reducing to ism the `` '' sample . '' ''
Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container .
I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container .
a .
Based on the students data you , can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics .
^p B ) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure .
Based on this student 's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B .
This creates hundreds of microsatellites , otherwise known as debris .
In order to replicate the experiment , the group 's procedure should mention which samples to use .
No matter the size of the debris , the speed can cause serious damage .
For example , pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koala 's eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
has all the information about how space junk has gotten into our atmosphere and what it is .
Based on the data , it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm .
Active transport , on the other hand , is a process of movement which does require energy .
These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment .
Pythons are capable of eating a bigger diversity and pythons often do best in and around human .
Pythons are invasive reptiles . ''
It 's a comet !
Mr. Leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what Paul had .
Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard .
Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels .
Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star .
You can tell from the story that Rose is a considerate person .
To this day , as he is telling the story to Paul , he is still unable to read .
The author uses heading to organize his article .
Rose also understands that she needs to keep her job .
Throughout the article , until the conclusion , the author says how dangerous and improtant the issues can be .
The procedure does not state what the samples are .
^p b ) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' is used to describe the reptile species being invaded into America .
When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship .
Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes .
He believes that Paul can do domething great .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
No energy is required for this process .
This is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'What Is Space junk ? '
The article implies that we should be more careful to avoid introducing invasive species , especially in Florida . ''
So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment .
The python would try to eat anything that it thinks its able to to eat .
1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2 .
The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories .
Therefore , a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse .
Mr. Leonard broke records but because he didnt have help with reading he failed his classes and flunked out .
Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics .
Now he realizes he is n't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident .
Next , tRNA comes along and attaches it 's anti-codons to the mRNA 's codons .
I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common .
The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples .
After reading the groups procedure , a few things are missing .
Learning Mr. Leonard 's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed .
I would need to know what the four samples of material are .
from this part of the story i felt that she was caring .
In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know what samples they used .
All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem .
They both ca n't read but both are good at track .
All this information is needed to replicate the experiment .
Passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane .
After this , actual examples of space junk are given .
It 's time to start your training . ''
They do n't state what the samples have to be .
The article says `` '' invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity . '' ''
Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials .
For example , 'What is Space Junk ' and 'Crash Course . '
In order to effectively replicate this experiment .
Last , the tRNA shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another .
The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits , but a big deal .
And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused .
They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format .
There fore it is hard for them to live in any other and find or environmental .
Though space junk is increasing , the author is hopeful for a solution .
When a new speices is introduced to an environment that animal is considered invasive .
Also , they should 've made sure they used the same weights .
This continues , creating a strand of amino acids , until a stop codon is reached .
On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather .
Black was an average of 53 , and Light gray was 45 .
Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples .
According to the student 's data , plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm .
Talking about what it is .
It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard .
In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm .
Pual had a reading problum which caused him to do poorly in school .
The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand .
Protein carriers also control movement of substances .
What is Space Junk gives the reader an idea of the junk that 's in space .
^p b . )
One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP .
First he has the introduction part of the article .
The informatioin that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard is about his past career as a college track star .
They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure .
Paul also realized that Mr Leonard and him shared the same feelings of embrassment when it came to school .
Endocytosis : In this process , a cell brings in molecules or substances , which requres energy .
Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration .
Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul .
white : : The paint color that they should use is white .
describes what 'space junk ' is and how it negatively affects the environment .
The author then closes the article with a good conclusion .
This would make the experiment more valid .
Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records .
^p B ) They could have done more trial and try other plastics .
In order to replicate this experiment , more information is needed .
The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story .
The mRNA is being transcribed .
They could be specific with how much the weights weigh .
Do the samples stay outside or inside ?
Also , if they should all start out with the same mass or not .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
Lastly , we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container .
Line 8 : 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash ? '
The data indicates them , but the procedure does not .
white : : White would be the smarter choice , because it reflects heat verses absorbing it .
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking .
For instance , one of the titles is called , 'Crash Course . '
A .
when a coach hides something from you feel suspcious and want get in on the action .
they are both different from the python by the python eat other animals and animal populations begin to dwindle .
I would need to get these items in ahead of time , and have the right things like containers .
We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment .
All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane .
The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat .
This requires energy .
Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels .
Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers .
We need to know how big the sample would have to be .
I believe it makes paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard is .
Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete , but not a good student .
These are titled 'What is Space Junk ?
It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone .
So Paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return .
This means that they can not live in a lot of places .
Hopeful .
In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers .
^p B ) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic .
Well , first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting .
Pandas and koalas are both vegatarians that eat bamboo and/or eucalyptus .
As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out .
He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read , just like Paul .
Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D , C , A .
For example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009 .
Translation takes place in the cytoplasm .
He want 's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him .
The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement .
white : : A white doghouse would absorb less energy , an d its temperature would be cooler .
Also , the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container .
Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing .
Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds .
.
This set-up provides background information for the readers to clarify the theme .
`` These students procedure was not a reliable one .
This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples .
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles .
This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains .
College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades did n't matter and that they would have tutors for him .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they only eat one thing .
In the story , Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes .
The introduction being attention to the atricle and makes you wonder about space junk .
When paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft .
As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
Finally , they need to say at what temperature they should sit ( room temp ) .
The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment .
1 .
As Mr. Leonard finishes , Paul indirectly offers to help Mr. Leonard with learning to read better .
There is a 11 ( DEG ) difference between the black and white colored lid .
Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most .
The author organize 's the article by headlines before talking about the article .
This section defines what his main idea is about and gives the reader a better understanding about his topic .
Since there as the of materials
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus , 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins .
They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers .
Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure .
The author organizes the article by explaining in the introductory paragraph what the topic of the writing is .
To finish the process , a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon .
( A ) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability .
Next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious .
Plastic type A stretch 10 ( mm ) on the first trial and 12 on the second .
Mr. Leonard 's background information inspires Paul .
The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections .
With a little training , we can do whatever .
It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well .
Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results .
More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes .
Mr. Leonard was a very poor reader and he failed college .
He felt empathetic ; he understood the hall monitor 's emotions completely .
You know by looking in the data table , when they do n't list items in the procedure .
He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close .
Also , how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample ?
They are diffrent because a python eats what animals , and the panda & koala eat leaves and bamboo .
'What Is Space Junk ? '
We would also need a control .
This means they are both dependent selective food source .
The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem , despite the small size of the debris .
The two produce a chain of amino acids.4 .
In step 2 , you need to be told how much vinegar to pour .
a .
This differs from a python because they eat meat can possibly hurt someone .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother .
One trait of Rose 's is that she is very caring .
Each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last .
This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat .
One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible .
How much weight was added .
He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he 's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed .
So the all came out equal .
They are different from pythons b/c pythons are generalists who can live in many different habitats successfuly .
The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error .
Paul states , 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
^p b . )
The author beings the article with an attention graber to introduce what the rest of the article will include .
Last , i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours .
How much should you have in each container ?
Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability .
a . )
Second , we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers .
It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite .
Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something . '
Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on .
Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm , the least out of all .
The way the procedure is written now we do n't know if the amount of weight was used constant .
It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics .
You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure .
Next , the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides .
Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers .
The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time .
In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added : ^p 1 ) What are the samples .
So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time .
I.e Hence the term `` '' invasive . '' '' ''
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
The narrator is amazed , and also moved by Mr. Leonard 's story .
That is a big deal .
Finally , the procedure does not include a control .
They did not specify what type of container or how large .
uder lamp manipulated : lid color
From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability .
The sections also make the article easier to navigate and read .
The first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space .
talks about background unformation such as when the first satellie was launched .
They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic .
His first heading , What Is Space Junk , gives the topic of the following paragraphs .
8 ) .
In the story Crossing Over , the character Rose is very hard working .
The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic .
He had a difficult time throughout high school and college .
white : : The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler .
Another way is add control to the experiment .
I was a good athlete ' , 'but not a good student . '
Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are .
The author organizes in a good way , by using sections .
The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container .
Very hopeful for good to come to her life .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Then , he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph .
Paul goes and helps Mr.Leonard as he help him .
There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment .
They when paul figured out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college , paul knew felt his pain .
It also makes Paul look up to Mr. Leonard .
The effect it has on paul , is to motivating .
He seperated it into three diffrent sections so you knew what you were reading about .
^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic .
The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion .
If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties .
The introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections .
The author goes on to give background information about the space program .
She explained that in the long run , and the troubles have settled , that it will benefit them .
A python swallowed an alligator .
The small little things that float around can damage entire space stations .
Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage .
The author organizes the article by starting with an attention getter .
This makes for a well rounded article .
I need to know what the four starting samples are .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable .
For example , adding little heat .
Also , I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials .
What temperature was the room at to make it dry .
This is a typw of active transport .
How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not .
Pandas only eat bamboo , and koalas bears feed to only eat leaves he stated in paragraph 21 .
Active transport uses energy .
As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels .
This relates to Paul because he ca n't read that well .
These specialist need their warm climates while generalists can adapt .
The independent variable is the type of plastic .
The story states , 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results .
A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane .
In the second section , Crash Course , the author tells you about the risks of the dead satellites .
They are also different from pythons because of the weather climate that pandas and koalas live in .
One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers .
Active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain .
^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials .
Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled ?
That really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph .
Rose can be described as consoling .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records .
One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant .
He actually begins to feel adequate .
The Author organizes this article in three different sections .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists .
The most flexible however , was plastic sample B .
It allows water in and out without trouble .
Therefore , that is how the author organizes this article .
Mr. Leonard said that he could not read either .
He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard 's kindness , but fails to see Mr. Leonard 's motives .
Paul was very suprised that he did n't tell him .
They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article .
I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself , but of her family .
Followed by B , D , C .
In return , Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the four plastics type I tested .
Also , the trial should be performed more than 2 times .
Now , with the understanding that he can achieve , he feels reason to pay back the favor .
there , the pythons reproduce and their population i.e harming five endangered species in tile area .
The autor organizes the article very well .
They are both different from pythons because pythons eat many of things .
Rose is compassionate .
Paul was also confused .
Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul .
White would absorb less solar and thermal energy , therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse .
In order to replicate this experiment , you would need corr
Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt because he too could not read .
Passive transport does not require energy .
Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past from the high school track coach .
Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well .
Rose is very considerate to the feelings of others .
Paul was concerned about why Mr. Leonard never told him about this .
Then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger .
He starts out as , describing space junk .
Next , he describes the severity of this topic .
a : The more weights added to sample b and a , the more they stretched .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they both eat one common food .
The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees .
Next , you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster .
Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell .
^p b ) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials .
Rose is described as motherly and realistic in her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab .
One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails .
However , the light gray lid had an average of 45 ( DEG ) in the tr ials .
Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful .
After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments , Paul thought of an idea .
A list of materials . ''
b ) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material .
She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too .
A third thing the procedure has n't told us is the amount of vinegar .
You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use .
However the lid was also a bit warm .
The word `` invasive '' is used to describe the reptiles many times throughout the article .
a ) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability .
That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart .
The information Paul soon recieves from Mr. leonard has a great impact on him .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here ' .
The jar with the black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C under the lamp .
They are specialist and pythons are generalist .
Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college .
However pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates .
`` The group neglected to include what the `` '' four different samples '' '' are .
Pythons on the other hand are carnivores and will eat almost anything moving .
In endocytosis , the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material .
They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists . ''
Paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is Mr. Leonard .
I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container .
The author starts this article grabbing the attention of his readers .
The article starts out with definition 'What Is Space Junk ?
The author wraps up the article by giving future problems that could occur
They are very different to pythons which are generalists .
Considerate .
It makes Paul think that he is not alone .
In fact , he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard 's accomplishment and showed it to him .
When he asks Mr. Leonard , 'What happened after that ? '
He also did n't know how to read and was becoming a great athlete .
In 'Crash Course ' the author says how the debris is created .
Also changing the environment could improve the experiment .
The author organized this article by making every section have a diferent topic .
He then explains in 'Crash Course ' what happens .
Pandas in China in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species .
The second section is about two satellites colliding wih one another , causing microdebris .
The articles names are ' What is Space Junk ? '
Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples .
I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours .
It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest .
This section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the Earth .
^P Measure the height of the table , weigh the weights .
The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without .
The author organizes his/her writing into different sections based on the importance of the issue .
The mRNA travels to the ribosomes.2 .
The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships , and how ships can not avoid it easily .
Plastic A is the least strechable .
I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures .
Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials .
He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate .
He/she then adresses the problem about 'space junk ' .
He see 's that anyone can do anything if they have help .
The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials .
Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in .
What are the four different samples .
For example , do they want us to use the same materials ?
Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA .
Also the group should use a control in this experiment .
Pythons can eat any thing while pandas and koalas ca n't adapt .
Both ?
They then go into a breif description of space flight .
They give examples about this topic .
The paragraph titled 'What is Space Junk ?
Pandas in china are similar to koala bears in Australia because they are both specialists .
One trait that Rose has shown is hopefulness .
Pandas and koalas are both specialist species and only eat , one type of food .
The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem .
One thing is the amount of vinegar used .
Firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment .
The author puts the information , into specificly titled sections , which makes this a very organized passage .
I would need to know how to measure I samples .
He begins by using an introduction that will get the attention of the reader .
That means that it is able to adapt to changes .
Rose is a caring person .
I would need to know how to determine the mass .
One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic .
after the readers attention is caught , he explains the reasoning for his introduction .
a , The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A .
Mr. Leonard answered I was a good runner but was n't a really good student .
Rose truly puts her family first .
The two ways students can improvr the experimenta ; design , is to always give it a 3rd try .
This section provides the reader with examples of satellites or debris crashing into each other at great speed .
The pandas eat bamboo and the koala bear eats only eucalyptus leaves .
One trait that can describe Rose is selfless .
My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag .
How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights .
I n the lab , the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed .
She did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her .
The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell .
Mr. Leonard then says he was n't a good student and his running career was ended because of it .
Active transport is the opposite of diffusion .
How do you measure the ending mass of each sample ?
Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house .
These additional steps would make the procedure better .
A python is different from this because they are generalist .
the samples should be kept at .
Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm .
white : : Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house .
she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
B . )
Paul was given informattion about Mr. Leonard from when he was younger .
He makes the topics seperated like this to look almost like a newspapper and to show each is important .
Also you do not know what the four samples are .
a ) Plastic type B was the stretchiest , and plastic type A was least stretchiest .
And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better .
Both eat one type of food and stay with it unlike python that can eat anything and everytime .
The catagories use were , 'What Is Space Junk ?
In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated .
black : : Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer .
The event of their dad moving away was for him to get more money .
Pythons are the opposite of pandas and koalas because they are generalist .
light gray : : Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse .
Leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes .
Paul says in the passage , 'It 's time to start your training . '
It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he wo n't end up flunking .
1 .
Because the color is not that dar k , but not that light ether .
The pandas eat bamboo from China & the Koala eat eucalyptus leaves .
It 's a plane !
Paul and both Mr. Leonard ca n't read , but they both excel in jumping hurdles .
Osmosis is moving water across a membrane .
One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials .
Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample .
Another plant , but grown from trees .
In paragraph 19 , the author writes , 'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
In paragraph 19 , 'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
I believe that Rose is careing .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm .
The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights .
Paul could easily relate to Mr. Leonard .
You would also need to have the samples all the same size .
He was just a little confused on why he did not tell him first .
However , Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he could n't read .
This is when the cell does not require energy to move .
It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials .
In order to complete this experiment , three aditional thing should be included .
The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic .
Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse .
The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial , and if needed , a fourth .
Paul could sympathize with this feeling .
He did not expect the man to be famous .
During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading .
And finally , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers .
The author organizes the article by makeing chapter like sections about different details .
The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting .
A Chinese Panda `` '' eats almost nothing but bamboo . '' ''
Then the author explains what space junk really is and how things become space junk .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful .
This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person .
Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard .
Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags .
It gives me brief information about the article .
In their procedure , they also should have
I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample .
Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ .
Paul realized Mr. Leonard was like him in many ways .
and they could have tested more types of plastics .
The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it .
The size of the containers you are using .
Also what size .
In this article invasive means living in an environment where an organism should n't be .
Uncomparable .
Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read .
First of all they did n't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment .
In order to replicate the group 's procedure I would need some more information .
Finally , it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be .
Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy .
You broke records . '
The author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration .
or by a light source makes a difference too .
paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard , he really felt for him .
I believe they are both different because pandas and koalas are harbivors , and pythons are carnivors . ''
The author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose .
Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type `` '' A it stretched 2mm '' '' .
Plastic A stretched the most with two mm .
Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read .
^p B ) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1 .
In the passage Rose says , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
They are specialists ; pandas only eat bamboo and koalas just eat eucalyptus leaves .
To be able to replicate this experiment , the group would need to add what each sample is .
Thirdly , how do we determine the mass of the samples ? ''
We also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space .
One trait that can describe Rose is determination .
In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color .
Rose puts her family before herself .
I would need the types of sample materials that are being used .
They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results .
The subtitle 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' Describes the Harmful effects of space junk .
Without this information our data could be different .
He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run .
In conclusion , plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each .
It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites .
Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature .
The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention .
While these animals share this lifestyle in common , the python contrasts them .
^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic .
a . )
Plastic B was the most stretchy .
They 're both different form pythons because pythons can eat anything and can almost survive anywhere .
And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end .
In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container .
Through this connection , they can both help each other out .
During trial 1 white was 42 ( DEG ) while black was 54 ( DEG ) .
She believes that when you help someone , they will help you in return .
Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also could n't read .
She also helps out Aunt Kolab .
A. based on the results , I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest .
She is hopeful .
Before defining space junk , a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced .
Also , they should have included before and after length in their design table .
Paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them .
Invasive species are nonnative species that are introduced to an environment and will eat indigenous species .
One trait Rose shows is caring .
They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup .
A trait I can identify from Rose 's conversations is that she cares about people in her famil .
Pandas and koalas ca n't be adapting like pythons can . ''
It does n't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that .
The background information on Mr.Leonard surprises Paul .
The additional information needed would be : the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup .
Finally , the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA .
Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read .
One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container .
Not just leaving it out of their processes .
The author organizes the article very well .
This method makes it easy to find important information about a certain topic .
The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water .
Then , he provides the audience with information about what space junk is .
You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are .
it stretched 2mm more in T2 .
They differ from pythons because pythons eat rats and other animals .
Mr. Leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing .
Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father .
The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell .
Another thing the student can do is add one more trial .
You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest .
She does n't answer truthfully , so they do n't know how hard all of it is on her .
temp. , and for the white lid the ave. temp .
...
The result is the newly created protein .
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul .
white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite .
And together , they can help each other have faith .
Mr. Leonard had trouble with reading but at his school , they did n't have a learning center .
Then the chain of amino acids is released .
'Crash Course ' was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions .
The cell can use diffusion , or osmosis if the cell is moving water .
He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle .
`` dark gray : : The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm .
Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane .
One trait the describes Rose is hard working .
The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete .
Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane .
They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use .
The amount of vinegar that each container would need .
Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard .
You can not obtain consistancy , a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment , in only two trials .
So that is how the author organizes this well written article .
Finally the group did not say the size of the container .
I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount .
A .
The author organizes the article into sections .
In conclusion , The author is just making it easier to understand .
white : : The black was 9 ( DEG ) C warmer then the white colored paint .
Dogs do not normally enjoy hot , stuffy enviornments .
Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for .
This is a conclusion that can be drawn .
The author explained how panda 's in China eats almost nothing but bamboo which means that he is harmful .
The beginning is a introduction or attention grabber to get you ready to read the report/story .
Koala bears in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves which are only found in few parts of the world .
Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B .
A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic .
To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used .
These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy .
In the article it says that pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
'why did n't you tell me about this ? '
Paul asked , 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him .
You feel okay ? '
Also , plastic type A stretched the least , only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm .
The background information given allows Paul to connect to Mr. Leonard .
There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment .
Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules ca n't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3 .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist .
Pythons however do n't need special things to live .
Based on the data , plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable .
They 're relatively harmless and are specialists .
The narrator is surprised at the information .
The word `` invasive '' is significant because it separates those are reptile impatalian and was against it .
By doing this he shows the differnet topices .
Rose said , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
There too Mr. Leonard 's freshmen year in collage he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals .
He had finally found someone who in all reality , was just like him .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is caring for others .
They both like stability , unlike the python these animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalists .
Then tells a little about the background information .
leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter dash and broke records .
In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers .
a . )
Then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this 'space junk ' can be .
He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college .
in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk .
One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because .
They both had learning problems .
They are both vegaterieuns .
What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope .
For example in paragraph nineteen it say 's Rose did n't answer .
When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past .
The effect , on Paul , about discovering the background information on Mr. Leonard is empathy .
Dark colors do not reflect light well , instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures .
He organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics .
the average temperature is 42 ( DEG ) c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get .
What type of vinegar , and what time you started .
Rose says to Anna in the story that 'He had to go .
Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle .
The author organizes the article by first introducing the problem at the beginning and then explaining the matter .
and ends with 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials .
When he is talking about space junk , he labels that section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use .
She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young .
When Paul learns Mr. Leonard 's background information he feels connected to him .
The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration .
According to the experiment , the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B .
The way she talks to her sister , Anna , lets you see she cares about her .
He did not want Paul to go through what he did .
The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed ?
They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two .
Just like Mr. Leonard Helped Paul with his training for Track .
Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b .
The author organizes the article in a very logical way .
Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2 .
It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass .
I also would need to know how many trials were their .
for example , the header stating 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The cell can also use active transport to move substances .
More trials would have increased the validity .
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring .
According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping .
`` Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists .
She can not attend because she is willing to work to keep her job .
Many people have gone through what he is going through .
Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic .
To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use .
a .
I would need to know what the samples were .
An example would be the python in the Everglades .
Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia .
B .
In paragraph 19 , it shows Rose thinking of others before herself .
The author organizes the article by putting it in sections that are related to eachother .
The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk , circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit . '
so white
After reading the group procedure , the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples .
The is how the author organizes this article .
Also they should of used the same amount of weights .
the author goes through many diiferent paragraphs and sections .
^p ( B ) The student could included more trials to add validity .
^p b .
However , he was a good runner .
After 'Crash Course ' , the next section is titled 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
You need to identify what that sample .
`` `` You could concavely have pythons sneaking their way up the Potomac . '' ''
'Do you feel weighed down by what you 're doing to help this family ? '
The auther organized the thoughts with ledgible Headings such as 'What is space junk . '
She is caring .
Rose is a helpful , kind loving sister .
I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher .
This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
To replicate this procedure I 'll need to know the size of the containers .
In the conversation Rose was having with Anna , she was trying to reassure her sister .
Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic .
So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school .
They both could n't read .
This makes Paul see him in a different light .
Paul realizes that if Mr. Leonard can be a great hurdler than he can .
Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar .
They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve .
Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star .
Plastic type 'D ' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested .
They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control .
Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment .
Supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article .
How much vinegar is needed in the containers ?
They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time .
After , he explains what happens in space with all the different satelites and how dangerous they can be .
The article says that invasive species are a threat to biodiversity .
Based on the students data results , plastic type D stretched the most .
For example , in the introduction 'Grab your telescope ! '
I would need the amount of vinegar of r container .
Pandas only eat bamboo , and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
By breaking records at his old high school he would go on to collage and run track .
One process is osmosis which controls how much water comes in and out of the cell .
That is an 11 ( DEG ) difference .
So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt , he felt embarresed .
This statement , made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally .
The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial .
Also , to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four .
The python , on the other hand , is a generalist carnivor that will eat any meat .
The author starts with an attention getter .
In order to complete this experiment , you would need additional information .
In the article it says all they do is eat .
Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
These leaves are specialists .
For example , the author uses uses the subtitle 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Rose is trying to be very optimistic during her conversation with Anna .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings , or thoughts before their own is a careing person .
The least stretchy would be plastic type A .
The author organizes the article by dividing the entire article into certain sections .
The firt part , or the introduction , gives us a small anecdote on what possibly could happen .
' , 'Crash Course ' , 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest .
The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment .
However , the article also claims that pythons are generalists .
He wants to try to do something for himself because of the affect Mr. Leonard had an on him .
He could have added more that 's .
The background information had a major effect on Paul .
Maybe it wouldnt . '
He not only overcomes his inability to read , but finds an outlet , and takes leadership in both .
To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2 .
Finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts .
You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample .
The author separates the article into four sections .
A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most .
Pandas and Koala 's eats depend on one food source Panda 's depends on bamboo .
white : : White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors .
Diffusion is also one , during diffusion a substance moves from high to low concertration .
In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding .
in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell .
the sample or what is being put into ?
You feel okay ? '
Then , they talk about various forms of space debris .
Rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family .
The author starts off with getting your attention .
In order to replicate the experiment , there is some information that was n't involved that is needed .
Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container .
( marble , limestone , wood and plastic ) .
Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well .
The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results .
Plastic type B stretched the most of all .
Assertive uses energy to move proteins acorss a cell membrane .
This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , but a Big Deal ' .
The group will need
Once grabbing the readers attention , he breaks the article into several segments labeled , 'What Is Space Junk ?
( b ) .
Rose is a very understanding person .
Based on the results founded , it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest .
This man had to given the time to help me excel at something .
Next he then explain his next section 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
`` `` What favors specialist is stability . '' ''
This is because it 's not supposed to live their and therefore altars the balance of the ecosystem .
What is Space Junk ?
The students need to say what the samples are .
The background information has a significant effect on Paul .
The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable .
Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well .
They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency or change in the experiment .
Passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances .
Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic .
For example , the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers .
The author then goes into an explanation of what space junk is , and why it poses a threat .
This leads into the subject that many people do , infact , care .
Paul was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard could n't read either .
Rose can be described by hopeful .
^p 2 . )
Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials .
You would also need to know what type of materials you need .
Paul said , 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles .
They are not limited on food like pandas and koalas are .
The explanation includes the background of it , and how it happens .
Mr. Leonard was a fantastic hurdler but not is n't very studious .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists while pythons are generalists .
b .
Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts .
When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein .
The effect on the backround information on Paul seemed like they made them very similair in a way .
With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials .
^p b .
One trait that can identify Rose is hopeful .
Paul works hard and deserves his spot to work with the high school team .
Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
black : : If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm .
In the beginning , he has a very good introduction that actually draws a reader into the story .
This trait is shown when she says , 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish college .
In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers .
The author starts his article with an attention grabber and briefly mentions space junk .
You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample .
She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes .
I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials .
Also it is not know how moch vinegar to use for each substance .
But , they are different because of the pythons spread across the remain in their country .
They should have used exact measurement when saying to `` '' add weight '' '' to the clamp .
The section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris .
The author then describes why there is space junk .
Plastic type D is the most durable .
We need those information to know how to do this experiment .
Mr. Leonard is likely trying to work out his own shortcommings by making Paul a good student and athlete .
The header stating 'Crash Course ' has the information about what happens when two satellites collide .
First , the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers .
The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA , forming a protein .
Rose 's response is , 'He had to go .
The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use .
Bamboo and eucalyptus leaves are both plants .
Also , adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment .
Also , for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used .
This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane .
The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport .
The tRNA is released from the ribosome .
Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial .
Pythons have already made the change of habitat to everglades in the U.S .
Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him .
Mr. Leonard then tells about how he could n't read , just like Paul .
He wanted to show respect and help Mr. Leonard do something too .
This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm .
In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait .
a .
The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists .
Rose is understanding about everything .
In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he 'll be able to read .
The author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space .
Pandas and Koala 's eat plants and nothing else , such as as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container .
They also included only the trial . ''
Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration .
I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup .
When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard 's past track excellence , he becomes inquisitive , then empithetic .
for example ' Grab your telescope !
She fakes a laugh , and pretends everything is okay , even when it is not .
3 .
Give a start and stop time put safety googles on .
I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad .
After Paul got a background check on Mr. Leonard it had really touched him .
The students could improve their results by repeating more trials .
black : : This color ( black ) will help the dog house stay/become warmer .
This vesicle can now travel into the cell .
As well as knowing what type of each substance you need .
describes what it is they are talking about and informing the reader .
white : : The lighter the color , the less air temperature .
white : : The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re .
They stated four Vinegar in each ... '' '' They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use .
'It 's time to start your training . ''
So , Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard .
' ) , and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did .
The python is an invasive speices to the everglades .
In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23 .
It 's time to begin your training .
In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure .
The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data .
Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33 .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
And Paul wanted to help .
`` In the article the word `` '' invasive '' '' signifies was against the introduction of reptiles .
The author starts off trying to lure the reader asking a question .
`` This group needs to include quantitative information such as , `` '' How much vinegar '' '' .
Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment .
This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic .
^P b .
Also , this procedure needs to include weigh the samples .
The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation .
After that is was time to do homework . '
She always , no matter what situation she is going through , is hopeful .
She cares about her sister Anna .
It is important to have them all be the same size .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was also a track star , and he is in amaze .
They could have also added what to measure in grams , kg , lo etc .
Rose did n't answer .
and 'are you feeling ok ' ?
mr. leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read , bc they didnt have help centers .
I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results .
It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into .
The author starts with stating the serious yet shocking facts of the article .
When Paul hears of the information about the hall monitor , Mr. Leonard e is shocked .
The difference bettween koalas and pandas is pythons eat meet and above any kind .
Overall , the article was assembled in a simple way that made it easy to understand for any reader .
The author organizes the article in four sections .
And what kind of container casinial use .
In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information .
Where as the python can adapt and it does not rely on only one food source . ''
When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay .
By stating the length and type of each plastic .
dark gray : : This color would keep the temperature just ri ght .
The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have .
This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it .
The introduction grabs the readers ' attention about the issue .
By explaining what is space junk and describing how it got out in space and is still out there .
With the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop .
Marble , limestone , wood and plastic in their procedure .
If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree .
This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is that she is caring .
I think that invasive is a passing judgment . '' ''
Plastic B was the weakest in both tests .
The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most .
Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much .
The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain .
It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied .
The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites .
^p - What kind of containers are being used .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane .
Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody .
Mr. Leonard 's hidden past affects Paul by making him curious .
Neither of these require energy for the cell to use .
The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time .
The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say .
You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need .
Then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other .
She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes .
Than the aithor stresses the dangers of small free floating particles in space .
'What 's rong ?
^p They also should indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample .
Rosa tries not to upset others .
Paul realizes that you do n't have to know how to read to be good in a sport .
What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there .
Both pandas and koalas eat only one thing .
If i Identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family .
Then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is .
Conclusively plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples .
They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one .
On hot days the dog would stay cool .
They are similar because they both only eat one thing and they are specialists .
Third , there is no control in this experiment .
Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic .
So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter .
Invasive brings a misconstreud idea of terror to the passage . ''
Then he talks about how stuff like this is a big deal .
First , I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
We need to work at things we think we ca n't do .
The author then supports the subtopics by details put in two to four paragraphs .
after that , they discuss what happens when two satellites collide .
They finally could have said what the starting length should be .
When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard , Paul feels empathetic for him .
It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too .
He also was bad at reading just like Paul .
) .
So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment .
Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were .
And that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center .
Biologists , however feel invasive species are major threats to biodiversity .
Look up in the sky !
A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins .
Lastly , he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that NASA is looking for a solution .
The thrid one is all about satellites colliding together and creating space junk .
He or she then tells you what space junk is .
Passive transport does not require energy , but active transport does .
Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon , the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein .
`` You need something like a scale to determine the mass .
It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours .
However , these results are not valid .
He tells about what is causing space junk and why .
These example show that Rose is a very hard worker .
However when Paul learns Mr. Leonard is illiterate , he feels sympathetic because they have a common condition .
The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two .
Also , I do n't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup .
Just saying samples is not specific enough .
Then he goes on and he describes how he was emabrassed because he could n't read too .
Also , in the experiment , white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors .
Then there is another title , 'Crash Course ' .
There were a few problems with this procedure .
They are different from pythons because pythons can live pretty much anywhere .
The background information makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard because he feels the same way .
'The emotions in Mr. leanard 's words were all to familier to me . '
The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity .
And how do you determine the mass .
Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside .
You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
`` `` Determine the mass of four different samples '' '' .
He then ask Mr. Leonard , 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
The last section is why the reader should care about the topic .
Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration , to an area of low concentration .
The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand .
The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least .
Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results .
B .
The author begins the article with a catchy indtroduction .
And type C , D were C , 14 T1mm , 13 T2mm , D 20T1mm , 20 T2mm .
I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container .
Rose is obviously an optomistic person .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship .
The darker the color , the more heat .
This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant .
They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists .
Paul didn understand why he quiet .
The Article 'Orbiting Junk ' is organized in a way that is most understandable to the reader .
You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be .
Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius .
2 .
The background information Paul found out on Mr. Leonard were familiar to him .
A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid .
This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return .
A ) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time .
It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence .
The author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the reader 's attention .
1 ) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length .
white : : Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler .
In order to replicate the experiment , i would need some additional information .
One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in .
Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too ca n't read .
A .
The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to .
You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use .
Paul is shocked by the background information that he receives from Mr. Leonard .
For example she says , 'Whats wrong ?
The author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used .
The group will need to put to the following information .
Energy Required.2 .
^p B .
The auther breaks up the article into subtopics.such as 'What is space junk ? '
Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure .
Paul is encouraged .
She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working .
When she was talking to Anna all she tried to do was cheer her up .
You pr obably do n't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white .
The author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is .
In order the replicate the experiment you need
Rose is a very responsible girl .
The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself .
'Anna , ' Rose said .
Paul learns that Mr.Leonard was very good at track in college .
It is well organized in different catagories and topics .
One trait is that Rose is optimistic ; she looks at things positively .
Cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane .
In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college .
Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him .
The author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections .
white : : I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both specialists animals .
In a way , she is responsible for her future .
The author organizes the article in a way of increasing importance .
And probably her aunt would tell her mom ' this describes her puting her familly before herself .
First is a small , shocking anecdote , which serves to grab the attention of the reader .
In this , I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person .
In this experiment , students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability .
You broke records . '
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four .
These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane .
The author organizes the article , by having a funny introduction .
The author organizes the article according to topic .
He then added the section 'Crash Course ' to provide information on satellite crashes .
The reason that the emotions are familiar to Paul is because Paul feels those exact emotions almost every day .
^p 3 .
Also , that plastic A was the least stretchy .
Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level .
This article is organized with a fairly common format .
Paul really wants to try now to read and teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Additional information would include , what were the four different substances .
The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as , 'Grab your telescope !
^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with .
To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for .
The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul .
the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article .
Rose is a caring person .
The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined .
Cells also use passive and active transport .
A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics .
I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching .
Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in .
The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance .
Third , you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal .
The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers .
Rose is very diligent .
Rose asks Anna if she feels okay .
So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing .
The author organizes the article well .
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard was such a great athlete .
2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to .
This lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere .
100 grams ) .
a ) Plastic type B is the strechiest .
The author organized the article , 'Orbiting Junk ' by adding different sections of reading .
It 's a comet !
Rose is compassionate .
When Anna walks in the room , she immediately asks her what the matter is , 'What 's wrong ?
It does n't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups .
The student could have done more trials or added on more time , for the plastics to stretch longer .
'Its only been four months , ' Rose said as gently as she could .
The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change .
Paul had experienced some of the same things that Mr. Leonard described from college .
This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly . ''
New proteins are made .
white : : They should use the white color because white does n't heat up as fast .
They both feel embarrassed because they ca n't read but like to do hurdles .
4 .
The author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere .
The second section explains how all of this space 'junk ' has gotten there .
Mr.Leonard relied on his friends to help him get by .
She begins the conversation with Anna by asking , 'Are you worried ? '
Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard 's shoes when he was younger .
In order to replicate the experiment , additional information is needed .
To Mr. Leonard .
Different environments could affect the date .
This article is organized in a topical manner .
Find his conclusion .
^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials .
However , you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed .
Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane .
Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used .
In the introduction , the author tries to hook the reader in about 'space junk . '
Became on the track team .
The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course ' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space .
The student could say how much weight he used .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by how they really just eat one type of food .
It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome .
The second thing would be to increase the number of trials .
The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2 .
The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first .
The amount of vinegar could impact the mass .
a ) Based on the data shown , the polymer plastics will streach but not much .
The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4 .
Rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education .
Paul knew exactly how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing how to read .
4 ) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins .
The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one .
Like Paul , Mr. Leonard was poor in school .
But was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard never could read .
Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm .
This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader .
If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp .
Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister , Anna 's life .
Mr. Leonard said , ' I looked good back then , did n't I ? '
The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be .
First , he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
He begins with Space Junk which tells about junk and satellites .
Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand .
The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied .
It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard .
^p b .
'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the Earth .
What environment is the experiment taking place in ?
The author organizes the article by putting it in headings .
They both could n't read well .
In short , invasive is passing judgement '' '' over the reptiles saying they 're invasive `` '' . ''
In the experiment the results show that the darker the color , the warmer it is inside .
Paul is puzzled by the information that he finds .
The author organizes the article with different sections all explaining different points .
The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit .
Rose is very considerate .
In order to replicate this procedures , you would need to know
One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test .
First , they did n't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor .
Pythons eat anything like when `` '' a python swallowed an alligator and ... exploded '' '' .
and to improve , the validity they should have done a third trial .
White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
The author then shows an example of two satellites crashing into each other , and an example of microdebris .
Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm .
The author organizes the article by giving different sections are the article titles .
The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3 .
Both animals are different from a python , who eats a variety of other living creatures .
Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle .
Then , he helps Paul learn the hurdles , and Paul begins to like him .
In order to replicate this groups experiments , you would need some additional information .
However , there are ways in which this experiment could be improved .
Second you will need to know the temperature of the room .
Pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Then he 'll get a job and pay for you and me to go to college . '
a . )
That 's why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment .
They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists , which means they can live many places .
Different tempuratures might affect the different samples .
A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins .
C went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out I guess .
Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability .
Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane .
Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood .
For example , the first section , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
To improve the experiment , the students could have done more trials to get better observations .
The python has a wider range of habitat and a less specific lifestyle .
.
These pets however are sometimes dangerous .
Rose is a very posistive individual .
You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers .
Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2 .
Like , at the end after learning Mr. Leonard 's past and how he ca n't read .
They also could 've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics .
Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration .
One trait that can describe Rose from the conversation with Aunt Kolab is conflicted .
Paul was all too familiar with the words Mr. Leonard had said .
After that , in the section titled 'Crash Course ' , the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted .
The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes .
( A ) According to the students data .
Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found .
These specialists species are different from pythons which are generalists because they can not survive anywhere in the world .
replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
Based on the student 's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity .
Diffusion-molecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration.3 .
Since he flunked out of college nobody wanted a runner that could n't read .
The background information has an effect on Paul because Paul can relate to it .
No other school wanted a runner who could n't read ' .
The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences .
The plastics also must all be the same length .
Lastly , they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container .
^p Also , they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched .
It will show him to never give up , and always try your best in life .
helps us understand the overall idea and explains the material in the article .
I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used .
So by stated facts with dates it makes it more interesting .
The procedure should include what the four different samples are .
He then learns Mr. Leonard broke records at college nationals .
She also does n't understand why money is so important to her parents .
light gray : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray .
This means that they can adapt very easily to new environments , whereas , specialists can not .
The author starts with the simple question 'What Is Space Junk ? '
He wanted to help him learn to read .
Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights . ''
`` `` Pandas and koalas have a limited area they can live .
The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better .
It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag .
I would also need to know what type of containers to use .
How much vinegar are whe poring ?
However , they vary from a python because a python can live numerous places throughout the world .
Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard .
Rose is very thankful .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
^p b . )
So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house .
The did a really good job organizing the article in subject filed manner .
^p c Would need to know what materials to gather .
This is what we must know to replicate this experiment .
When Mr. Leonard explains fully however , Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding .
In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things .
A constant variable was not included .
And at last have more trials .
The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used .
Rose is very hopeful .
They both like to eat certain food .
He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name .
Mr. Leonard also helps Paul not feel like an outcast .
To tell me what the samples are in the procedure .
Having different sizes might change the results .
She did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt .
Pandas mostly eat just bamboo , and koalas generally only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Paul was also shocked to the discovery that Mr. Leonard could n't read either .
Also , the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials .
Shes wishes for alone time and free time , but knows she has the duty of helping her family .
Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested .
One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic .
So durin g the summer , the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house .
They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in .
Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B .
Paul explains how he feels the same way now as Mr. Leonard had in the past .
Constant keep the results of experiment valid .
The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills .
Paul understands that feeling of embarrassment .
This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna .
One thing you would need to know is what use of containers you need .
^p b ) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added .
Pandas and Koalas are both specialists .
Like the text says 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
In this experiment , the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure .
After that , the author finishes up , but without a specific conclusion .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is both a track star and a poor reader .
The author organizes the article in different sections .
The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows :
In the third section titled 'Crash Course ' , the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse .
They basically have the same issuses in their lifes .
The third section descirbes a specific event that led to space junk .
The author organizees the article in an easy to understand way .
The author organizes this article into four main parts 'Orbiting Junk ' , 'What Is Space Junk ?
She 's caring towards her family memebers .
Then in the next two sections he goes into greater detail about how it 's a problem .
They also should have used the same amount of each plastic .
When Paul goes to the track coach , the coach tells Paul to look up the name 'Grabowski . '
She assured her that her father was doing the right thing by working in Los Angeles .
In the fourth and fifth paragraph he is telling information about what has been sent to Earths atmosphere .
The author begins the article 'Orbiting Junk ' with a comment on something seen in space .
The article begins with an enticing introduction .
They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data .
Should it be sunny , dark , windy , hot , cold , etc .
This is proven because in each trial , white had the lowest temperature .
Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles , and so is Paul .
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read .
The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black .
This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete .
Another improvement could 've been to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment .
Determine what the different samples are , then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample .
Unlike pythons that eat a variety of animals , rather than a specific plant .
They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights .
Well , the strongest effect that website about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was shock and suprise .
Pythons are diffrent .
You can tell this because she 's worried about her sister .
Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers .
A python will eat anything .
How does the author title the article , he titles is to help the reader .
Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well .
Active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient .
^p 2 ) They should repete the experiment more then one time .
In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was just like him in school ; Couldnt read .
If pandas or koalas are taken out of their natural habitat , they will most likely not survive .
The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder .
The students should also include the temp .
They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares for the well being of others .
Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags .
A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use .
Plastic type A was the stretchiest .
But she is doing what she can to make the best of it .
This person also starts out by asking a question and then going into what is Space junk .
We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
Even if it is just a small thing floating around , it could cause alot of harm .
The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing , and is still a problem .
1 ) You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at .
She is considerate to others feelings .
`` Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists and only eat one food .
After hearing this Paul wanted to help train him with his reading .
As the author says , `` '' China 's panda which eats mostly but bamboo .
Mr. Leonard Girabowski , a track star .
Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first .
As stated in the article , they can almost anywhere because of their ability to adapt . ''
One characteristic that can adequately define Rose 's personality would be hard-working .
The author organizes the article with little articles in it .
Paul made a great friend that day .
and a panda `` '' eat almost nothing but bamboo '' '' .
Mr. Leonard trained Paul , so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read .
and 'Crash Course ' These titles help us understand the things the author is trying to explain .
Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner .
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists , while phythons are generalists .
That is why she is a very giving person .
The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion .
Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides .
these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites .
I lost my scholarship and flunked out .
I would need the amount of roch in each container .
Pandas and koalas are both considered specialists whereas pythons are generalists .
Type B stretched 22 ( mm ) on the first and 23 on the second .
The third process is called diffusion .
I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount .
Basically , it is a well organized informative essay .
`` Many species go on the verge of being extinct due to predators becoming more abundant to an area .
Therefore , black is the better color to paint the doghouse .
By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different because the China pandas eats nothing but bamboo .
It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
A .
She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college .
They both ca n't read but are willing to try and get better at anything .
This shows that she cares about her family .
the embarrassment when he did n't know the answer .
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could n't read , like himself .
However , pythons eat meat , like other animals .
One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used .
Rosa was kind to Aunt Kolab when she did n't answer the question .
But yes I am shure that Paul was very suprised once he looked up the website .
In the story , Rose is hopeful .
The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic .
Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer .
First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup .
^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried their sample .
The author organizes the article by first introducing the topic and that it poses a threat .
The last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be .
' , the author explains how the engines used to power spaceships are disintegrated .
a ) Based on the students data , I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability .
Telling us that he ca n't read , such as Paul ca n't read .
Then , tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA .
A .
Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard could n't read .
Last , the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change .
`` 1 .
The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results .
He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts .
a . )
They also should have included the size of the plastic samples .
^p b ) 1 ) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape .
he says they are `` '' introduced '' '' and are less of a threat than the government thinks .
Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite .
Such as the titles 'What is Space Junk ? '
The author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled 'What Is Space Junk ? '
More trials can show a trend in the data while only two ca n't .
The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read .
Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag .
consists of two paragraphs .
Their only food source is where they live .
Paul was more than happy to help his new freind .
Finally , they tell us that this is serious matter and we have to face it .
This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems .
In this type of transport the cell does not use energy .
Another process used by cells is cellular diffusion .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was just like him , Mr. Leonard could n't read well either .
For example : in subsection What Is Space Junk ? , the author explains exactly what is space junk .
The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well .
What IS Space Junk explains to the readers about what kind of items are left behind in space .
a ) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least .
Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ?
How much vinegar rinse or how long
'Crash Course , ' shows why space junk is important .
After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing .
First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass .
If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
Then in each section the author gives details about the topic of the section given away in the titles .
This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab .
Paul related to how he felt , being part of a select few not knowing how to read .
As well as plastic A having the least .
This information also makes Paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he 's at school .
Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story .
The author organizes the article in sections .
It 's a meteor !
Rose is a hardworking girl .
What type of container should the sample be put into ?
thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot .
Then after it leaves the nucleus , it enters the cytoplasm .
What sample ?
He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well , what happened after that ? ' .
Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people .
Mr. Leonard did n't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading .
`` Australian koalas and Chinese pandas seem a world apart .
Also the type of container needed .
Paul has help , from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard .
The background information help him connect with Mr. Leonard on a whole new level .
I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended .
showing that she wants what is best for her brother .
Without this section , one may be confused as to what the author is talking about .
^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couid n't properly replicate the experiment .
Rose did not reply to her Aunt 's question if she was feeling weighed down for this reason .
The given procedure does n't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers .
a .
Repeat trials again ( 3rd time ) .
I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment .
Every week , Mr. Leonard asked the same question - 'Where are you going ? ' .
^p How much weight to rise .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me . '
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both mainly eat one type of food .
He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere .
How much vinegar to put in the container , say if there was any repeating the trial .
You would need to know what materials to get .
Then the author tells the reaeder why they should care about space junk .
`` Both pandas and koala bears eat plants .
The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA .
First , they need to specity what the
I would also need to be able to know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample .
For example the very first paragraph after the introduction has a headline that says What Is Space Junk ?
Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use .
One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers .
The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion .
Also could have under control .
white : : If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder .
Diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration .
she goes to school then works 4 hour shifts after school , then helps fix supper .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist .
It then begins translation when the anticodons from the tRNA match up with the codons on the mRNA .
' ( Build up ) .
^p Improve : ( 1 ) .
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded .
Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts .
They are killing off natural animals such as the key largo wood rat .
a ) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not .
These two species differ from a python because a python is a generalist .
A ) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable .
To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment .
Second , the procedure did not specify how big each samples should be .
The author organize his article in sections according to the topic .
It shows that she is caring
black : : The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside .
I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses .
This way , the dogh ouse would be around 48 ( DEG ) .
And also the site of the container needed for this experiment .
This is needed for comparison .
Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial .
The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable .
The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article .
And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did .
Since he was going through the same .
The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers .
According to Paul , 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something ' .
Pythons are a danger to other species unlike pandas and koala bears who only eat plants .
Because of this crash their are Hundreds of millions pieces of satellite in space now .
Do I cover the containers ?
Active transport-requires energyPassive transport- requires no energyosmosis- the movement of water from one place to another
It is almost a 'payback ' deal , except Paul is happy to help Mr. Leonard .
Endocytosis and exocytosis are used to control the what substances enter and leave through the plasma membrane .
They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live off of eating many different foods .
^P 2 ) They could 've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes .
Sections are clearly separate from one another .
He understands why he was helping him out with the hurdles .
Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment .
I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment .
Then , Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college .
It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through .
Just like Paul could n't .
The second is to list the far samples in the procedure .
One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container .
tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand .
So , he was going to teach him how to read .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus , it attaches to a ribosome .
Paul is curious as to what happened to his career as a track athlete .
so he told mr. leonard its time to start your training
^P B ) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer .
It 's a tool bag ? '
Koalas on eucalyptus .
The first paragraph , the introduction , introduces the topic of the article .
Paul is greatly influenced by Mr. Leonard 's background information and story of his life throughout college .
Osmosis , is the movement of water through the cell membrane .
White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible .
If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm .
`` To replicate the group 's experiment , more information is neccesary .
^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge .
In Crossing Over , it says , 'But her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter . '
This is a quote taken out of the passage .
This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring .
Paul connected Leonard because they both had a hard time reading .
Just like Mr. Leonard did by helping him get on the track team .
Paul gets a little suprised on what he finds out about Mr. Leonard .
That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house .
Nor .
Finally , we need to know which materials to use .
Paul was n't aware of this and asked why .
Paul relates to him because he has the same difficulties as Mr. Leonard .
Plastic type `` '' A '' '' has the worst stretchability .
In order to replicate the experiment , the procedure would have to add more details .
This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse .
In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm .
Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college .
Carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell .
Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with , and how .
The backrground information shows how similar paul and Mr. Leonard are .
One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic .
Rose is trying to be optimistic about the situation even though she does not feel it .
When he meets Mr. Leonard , Paul becomes motivated by him .
The words `` '' A sample '' '' does n't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed .
This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment .
The author organizes the aritcle by topic .
Therefore , Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career .
In the text it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
You would need to know how big of cups to use .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists .
'Little Bits , But a Big Deal , ' describes how truely dangerous these things can be .
I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used .
Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment .
Caring 'Anna ' 'what 's wrong ? '
She listened to Anna and helped her get over her bad dream .
In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A .
One example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the US .
Mr. Leonard never had help with reading and he failed college .
Mr. Leonard responce was ' I was a good Athlete , but not a good student .
2. types of sampling .
The author breaks down the article into three different sections .
They have to be clear and actually name them also .
A ) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it 's greatest length was 23mm .
When Paul does find out his story he asked about it .
Even though he felt embarrassed by the past .
For step three , it does n't specify what material or what size container to put the material in .
I believe that the word `` invasive '' means something like un natural and that it doesnt belong .
But after he explained about hies past to Paul .
Rose , while feeling overwhelmed , tried to be optimistic in most situations .
Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track .
Lastly , the author explains how scientists are trying to fix the space junk problem .
This adittional data will make the results clearer .
They are both different than pythons because pythons are generalists and they eat meat .
This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of .
Then , how much vinegar should be added to each container .
The author organizes the article using an introduction , two body sections and then a conclusion .
The author ends by explaining how space junk poses a big problem .
Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard 's words .
They and both different from the pythons because can survive in more than one place . ''
Also I would need to know how top measure the mass .
Also , how much distilled water I would need to use .
for black was 53 ( DEG ) , while the average for white was 42 ( DEG ) .
He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records .
We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup .
All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had , Paul had the exact .
Both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read .
Finally , I would need to know what to label each container .
He had felt like he had something in common with Mr. Leonard .
Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material .
this is how he does it .
Then he ends it by talking about how it can affect us .
Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy .
Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings .
Humans have animals as pets , a large and potray source .
( a ) Based on the students data , I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least .
Paul was amazed that Mr. Leonard 's background information was that he broke college records his freshman year .
in support for him .
After hearing Mr. Leonard 's story , Paul made a mental connection with him .
In the story , Paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader .
While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm .
^P Add another type of plastic .
In addition , one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
Plastic type B stretched 22mm , then 23mm the second time .
`` In conclusion to this data , I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic .
For example , One section is called 'What is space junk ? '
Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair .
Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period .
Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are both specialists .
Another way is by deleting human mistake , by meaning correctly and things like that . ''
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists .
Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could n't read , nobody really helped him .
^p b ) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length .
^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them .
The length of the plastic samples should also be the same .
The python can live almost anywhere and eat a variety of things .
They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct .
With more specific information this would be a well written procedure .
The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump .
Also , make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic .
T hat is shown by the data , in the 20 ( DEG ) C increase in temp .
Second , you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment .
This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane .
Then the author talks about how in space it 's really not that safe .
The darker the lid , the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat .
She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna .
Mr. Leonard was a track star ut he could not read .
Another would be to make the procedure more understandable .
^p Initial amount for each samples . ''
Within these groups are the information in an orginised mannor .
She feels pressure but still feels the need to help the best way she can .
Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability .
This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful .
They both had problems reading .
China 's panda eats nothing but bamboo , Australia 's koala bear that eats eucalyptus .
Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him .
For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes .
'Anna , 'Rose said 'What 's wrong ?
The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader 's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope !
Without these , I could not replicate this experiment .
Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to be added to each ,
tool bag ? '
By using the same weights , we would know that the plastics are stretched fully .
This is a positive view that an optomistic person would have .
I would state that plastic B stretched the most .
It made Paul think that he has someone who understands his troubles with reading .
Crash Course talks about crashes of space junk and Little Bits , But a Big Deal talks about micro-debris .
a .
The background information about Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize how fortunate he was and that he was n't alone .
Animals have been divided into two sections ; specialists and generalists .
If you can achieve a goal you can do anything .
^p 2 ) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers .
This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team .
The first one is called 'What is Space Junk ? '
i say that because , he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did .
white : : White will affect the dog house by making it cooler .
First the author presents the problem , space junk .
Paul felt closer to Mr. Leonard because they had the same emotions .
Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more .
Selective permeability is a process that allows certain things in the cell and keeps certain things out .
It show when she does not answer her aunt to keep from hurting her aunt 's feelings .
It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space .
The author then gives background information of how the space junk got into orbit .
of air in the lab as white does n't attract heat like black does
Second it does n't state what are the samples like what rocks they are .
When her sister came into the kitchen , Rose asked what was wrong .
Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course ' .
Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself .
Secondly , in step two , I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
^P The student could 've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
The author talks about satellite crashes and the results of them in the second section .
They are unlike pythons , which will eat a more general selection of prey from wood rats to alligators .
^p b 1 . )
Once he finds this out , he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past .
Second , you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers .
Plastic type B stretches the farthest .
The way Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes Paul a little emotional .
Also how much vinegar to put in the container .
All the other sections follow a similar suit .
Until then , she is doing everything .
No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read .
This made Paul feel better about himself , because he is n't the only on with the problem .
After hearing Mr. Leonard 's story , he felt as though he should give back .
It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed .
The second one , being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs .
It 's a comet !
Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m .
( line 47 ) .
We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did .
Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing .
They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect .
What plastic , how long are they etc .
For example , the article says that the pythons in Florida are imperiling five endangered species .
White would be the best choice for the doghouse .
They gave different statistics about the various parts of space junk , that was addressed .
With the data recorded .
Each Subtitle leads into one another very nicely , and does not get uyou confused .
Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center .
Endocytosis .
This leads into Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass .
He knows that even if he ca n't read like everyone else he can still be good at something .
The author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together .
He could n't beleive that the an in front of him was a track star .
white : : White would be the best color to paint the do g house .
This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment .
This makes the article much easier to understand
This shows how she cares about her sister .
Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school .
'Crash Course ' , tells people about some crashes that have happened while in space .
They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment .
When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard 's past , he does n't get discouraged .
`` Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both only eat one thing .
How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for ?
The author makes these description in the paragraphs of 'Crash Course . '
Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight .
The author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way .
The article is a well organized piece .
The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose did n't answer .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past he is surprised .
Following that , the next catagory is 'Crash Course ' he talks about what could go wrong with satallites .
The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis , active transport and passive transport .
A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment .
Finally , they end with saying that NASA is trying to fix this problem .
Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration .
The article deals whether or not this is true of this case .
In conclusion , plastic type B had stretched the farthest .
Rose said , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
The procedure should contain what different samples are going to weighed .
Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab .
Paul did n't know why Mr. Leonard did n't tell everyone that he broke records .
Bamboo is a plant grown in Japan .
That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab .
Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk .
^p 3 .
Rose said ' What 's wrong ?
The third explains how even the littlest bit of space junk can harm satellites or other space objests .
The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class .
From the section Orbiting junk , he uses excitment for his tone of vioce .
After school she goes to work , then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner .
Also they should have included another trial .
How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not .
Plastic type be was the most stretchable .
I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container .
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused .
Both species rely on specific conditions such as climate and food sources which restrict them from living anywhere else .
At the ribosome , the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons .
In the experiment , black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar ( 53 ( DEG ) C )
Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ?
The students could have done one more trial to justify their results .
Rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset .
She asks her what 's wrong and if she is feeling okay .
They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container .
First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design .
A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m .
But Paul also realized that him and Mr. Leonard had a lot in common , and it inspired him .
Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes .
The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights .
In order to replicate this experiment , there are a few more things I need to know .
He is going to teach him how to read .
Next they talk about how the debris free-orbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris .
In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm .
Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results .
When Mr. Leonard gives Paul some background information on his life , Paul begins to relate to him .
He breaks it down into different topics .
the protein then goes and does its job in the body .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard ca n't read just as Paul ca n't .
China 's panda Australia 's koala are similar as they are both considered as specialists .
Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand .
They destroy the ecosystem by either attacking other predators , eating all the food , or destroying the enviroment .
For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same .
That Mr. Leonard was good but not school wise .
They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about , space junk .
They needed to include what time they started and when they ended .
2 .
`` `` Invasive '' '' means a lot to this article . ''
Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them .
Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid .
Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA .
^p b . )
Paul sympathizes with him because he has a hard time reading too .
^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well .
Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it .
is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information .
Rose didnt want to hurt Aunt Kolab , or make her feel bad .
Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school .
I fell asleep working on my essay , ' Rose said .
In trial 1 it stretched 22mm , and trial 2 it streached 23mm .
He realizes that they are much a like .
There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure .
The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it .
^p B . )
a ) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample .
Type D made no change , it streched the same amount for both trials .
Rosa said to Anna 'What 's wrong/ You feel okay ? . '
He goes through the order you need to know things .
Mr. Leonard was just like Paul at his age .
Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record .
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling .
To get the total weight added would 've improved validity .
He sees how even though Mr. Leonard could n't read that he still excelled past people in something else .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him .
Plastic type A was the least stretchable .
Based on the students data , the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability .
The dog would n't want a hot sweaty dog house .
However , snakes are becoming overly popular .
( 2 ) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers .
It seems like he 's been gone for years , ' ( para .
`` A Panda from China is similar to a Koala because they both really on one food source .
Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard , he is encouraged , almost dumbfounded .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar .
This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close .
This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain .
What temperature would the samples be in , would it be the same or would it be different ?
Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard .
It gave Paul hope that some day he would be able to read .
The student could have had another trial .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years .
The first paragraph is to get the readers attention , and make them want to read the story .
In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
The author organizes the article by starting with an introduction to get the reader intrested .
The procedure is missing some critical info .
Paul becomes curious as to why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him .
Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
For example one section is 'What is Space Junk ? '
The most stretchable would be plastic B .
You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them .
so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog .
Mr. Leonard too could not read .
In the story Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard .
so not too much thermal energy , but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best .
The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration .
They are different from pythons because they move to a new environment and adapt as well .
The author organize the article by using subheading , and a strong intro .
The author organizes his article by starting with an introduction which he uses to pull the reader in .
Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt .
Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample .
a ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most .
Dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) .
He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read , just like himself .
Conclusion : There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic .
.
2 .
Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm .
2 .
Plastic type B has the most stretchability .
`` `` step 1 '' '' cut a 2omm strip of each plastic '' '' .
It 's a meteor ! '
The number of pythons are quickly and began to overtake the Everglades .
Then when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard cant read either he has remorse for him .
In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know what the samples were .
After reading the groups procedure , i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed .
( 1 ) When mRNA leaves the nucleus , it travels through the cell to a ribosome .
^p -In step 6 , it should say to correct the new mass of each sample .
There fore it can survive in a variety of places .
It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table .
I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work .
So Paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center .
Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read .
iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest .
A python eats other animals and pandas and koalas eat plants .
Will we completely submerge it or only partially ?
The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container .
dark gray : : The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray .
Paul even states'The emotion in Mr.Leonard 's words were all to familiar to me . '
As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial .
the author than staes an instance where space junsk acused an accident .
You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in .
Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2 .
Mr.Leonard had trouble reading and end up losing his scholarship and flunked out of college .
He then tells people about the satellites and what happens to them .
describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from .
Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm .
Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment .
Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm .
Osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane .
The author organizes the article by what the catergories are .
Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike , neither of them can read very good .
Having sections makes it easier to find the information you 're looking for .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me . '
In the experiment , lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature .
black : : The black paint would absorb heat .
a ) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A .
1 ) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most .
the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space .
Like When She feel asleep working on her essay .
and 'Crash Course ' .
Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use .
Then the article tells about the crash course .
He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through .
I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at .
With this additional information , one could now replicate the experiment .
Learning about Mr. Leonard 's background information gives Paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer .
Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container .
a .
He 's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before .
This boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes Paul want to achieve goals .
Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible .
It had the most amount stretched .
However , the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results .
Also how big the container would be .
They are able to survive in different climates to adapt to places in different regions .
The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way .
^p B ) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging .
The author begins the article with an attention getting introduction , followed by historicle statistics .
He was grateful for everything , so he decided to return the favor .
Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights .
To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you 're using .
`` Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both `` '' specialists .
It also later goes into telling the risks of satellites controlling eachother .
A word that describe her is caring .
The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk ?
In the data , plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1 , and 23mm in T2 .
After reading the group 's procedure , I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment .
They have a common problem with reading .
They were spread then appear similar species .
The author starts out with a good , exciting introduction .
In that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off Paul 's college loans .
a . )
The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics .
And also that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades .
Bad reading skills , trained to get good at track , etc .
Paul is motivated because Mr. Leonard had the same problems Paul is sturggling with .
Also , the measure of the weights were n't specified .
Paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read .
For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described .
In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain , you need additional information .
This introduction makes people want to read on .
Determine an amount of vinegar .
The author let 's the reader know what each part will be about .
The effect Mr. Leonard 's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him .
Also , they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used .
Being a specialist , they do not like change and would rather stick to a more stable environment .
Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm .
These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample .
To replicate this experiment , I would need to know more information .
When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL , and Paul looks him up , he realizes something important .
Rose is being thoughful when she does n't tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings .
Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data .
Next , the author really explains to the reader what space junk is .
but insted is willing to go through them so anuther family member does not have to doo something else .
Black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) , whereas whi te had only 42 ( DEG ) .
Roes is caring .
She did not want to desappoint them but she was too stressed to work all the time .
The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm .
^P 2 .
Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard 's troubles .
This also tells us about the free-orbiting objests .
So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read .
Because Paul discovers this , he feels a drive .
b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct .
Finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and Earth 's surface .
^p B ) These students should have conducted a third trial .
The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains .
The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples .
Mr. Leonard could n't read , so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it .
This in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother .
The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid .
It 's Superman ! '
You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
) Why does n't it matter which sample ?
Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most , and plastic type A stretched the least .
white : : A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside .
In the story Rose is a very mature girl .
`` Panda from China are similar to Koalas from Australia because they are both example of specialist species .
^p b .
Caring Rose says 'We have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job . '
^p b . )
^p 1 .
Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well .
Lastly , there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container .
Climats , making it difficult to survive in a variety of areas .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
^p b . )
such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled ( Crash Course ) .
In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things .
A .
MacInnes , however , says that calling these species `` '' invasive '' '' is passing judgement . '' ''
All of this is to help her family .
Plastic type B streched the most , in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm .
Based on the student data , plastic type B stretched the most .
The author organizes this article so that it is easy for the reader to understand .
white : : Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun .
The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk .
We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container .
I do n't know if they need to stay at room temp , cold or not .
He talks about the different types of space junk in the section .
One section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is .
I believe they want to show how animals differ with their food source availability .
A .
Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share .
Finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is .
Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit .
It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy .
The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
Rose respects her elderes and doesnt want to hurt their feelings .
What do you measure the mass in
To replicate the experiment , I would have to know the size of its containers I use .
They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container .
A ) Based on the procedure the results were not valid .
He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades .
Instead of seeing some meteor or comet , the author sees a toolbag in space .
Although Mr. Leonard was amazing at track and field , his grades declined and he flunked out of highschool .
molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
Mr. Leonard use to be a big track star .
Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through .
Paul got a glimpse of his future .
He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner .
The by giving the article different sections with different names graps more attention .
First he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction .
It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed .
Line 4 : 'In 1957 , the Soviet Union launched th efirst artificial satellite .
And , like how Mr. Leonard had helped him , Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard .
With plastic C , the results decreased by one mm .
Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard .
The author organizes the article by putting side heading into the story .
Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to .
Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances .
First they should list the samples they used .
headline .
What containers and what are we supposed to label ?
I would also need to know where to store the cups .
was 42 ( DEG ) C. controlled varible : temp .
One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring .
So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table .
Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there .
One can see that Rose 's life is very busy .
It 's a comet !
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup .
The groups prosedure could use , they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end .
The author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand .
white : : the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler .
The information Paul learns inspires him .
^p 2 ) How much vinegar I need to pour .
Facilitated Diffusion , energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration .
Under 'Crash Course ' the author explains how sattelites colide into eachother .
Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary .
Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past .
The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z .
You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of .
This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read .
It could hold the most weight , without stretching .
It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period .
The author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information .
The backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind .
Paul knows how if feels to not be able to read .
Plastic D is the least stretchy .
The effect the background information had on Paul was one of surprise .
He ca n't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college .
These animals are different from pythons because they are more adaptive .
Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2 .
Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles .
Passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones .
A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest .
The third section is what 's going on now with the topic .
Rose wants to be the big person .
This makes them similar but different from pythons because pythons eat other animals unlike koalas & pandas .
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read He wants to help him .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is comforting .
This guy was just like Paul .
b ) ( 1 ) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement .
^P b .
Osmosis and diffusion are passively transport , meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy.3 .
A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment .
The first tRNA floats away , leaving the amino acid behind .
The mRNA finds the ribosome.3 .
For example this student said take a sample of one type , instead she cold have said whch one .
a ) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm .
' , indicating that he is going to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well .
a .
She is working so her brother Paul can go to college .
He explains what goes on that we do n't know and that we do n't think goes on .
The word `` '' invasive '' '' helps to provide debate on this article . ''
The author then describes in great detail what exactly space junk is and what is made up of .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane .
Paul greatly appreciated that an old star was helping him with his hurdles now .
By attracting more light , it usually makes things much warmer .
If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid .
9 ) .
And they should keep the weights on for longer , this will give more extensive and accurate data .
The author organizes the article by starting at the history of space explorations .
a .
Mr. Leonard then went on to explain the whole situation and this inspired Paul .
Each sample should be the same size .
One of Rose 's main traits in the story is her selfless determination .
Rose is very responsible , as her telling Anna about their duty helping Paul finish college shows .
But pythons eat other animals .
She understands why there Papa had to leave .
I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid .
When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard 's background it was all to familiar to Paul .
Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul , Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard .
Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane .
It explains that it 's not going , like , five miles and hour , but THOUSANDS !
I knew them well . '
The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this .
Mr. Leonard was great at track and lost his scholarship because he could n't read .
To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information .
The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome .
Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought .
The author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction .
Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp .
The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' had great significance in the article .
In his procedure , it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely .
At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'It 's time to start your training .
The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way .
They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant .
Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star .
It would n't be to hot or to cold for the dog .
Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample .
Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read .
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star , Paul becomes more motivated .
Based on the students data , plastic type B is the stretchiest .
He is also empathetic towards Mr. Leonard .
They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container .
^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same .
The writer splits the most important facts into seperate paragraphs .
I order of the stretchiest would be B , D , C , and A .
Pandas in China only eat bamboo , koalas in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves .
a . )
The term invasive is just saying how the animals forced out and go to new places and live there .
The best plastic type would be A .
This is very significant because this means their numbers can not be kept in check and they might overpopulate .
For example under 'What Is Space Junk ?
Rose has a positive attitude .
My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy .
After being told this , Paul feels simpathy for him because he too can not read .
'It 's time to start your training . '
The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length .
We had no learning centers in our school .
How are you going to measure the mass ?
It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm .
Rose is considerate of other peoples feelings .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic .
I would need to know what size or shape of container to use .
In the introduction it catctes the readers atention by using shocking statements .
The two trials confirm this result .
One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability .
Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it .
Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete .
He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles .
Shows why we should be worried .
By putting the articles in there owns subject like 'What Is Space Junk ? .
If she to ; d the truth she would hurt her aunt .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
The author starts off with a piece of space junk in the air .
and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees .
Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples .
When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What 's wrong ? '
It uses no energy because it still diffusion .
Finally , the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem .
A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon .
Then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling .
The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read .
Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track .
Paul says , ' The emotions on his face were all to familiar to me . '
Look up in the sky !
She also mentions to Anna how her father has to work hard to send Paul to college .
1 .
You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers .
This would have made the experiment more conclusive .
I believe that the author did a good job of organizing this article .
Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3 .
He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does .
Its diet changes according to its surrounding food sources .
The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times .
At the end of the story Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
So Paul decided to help him read .
All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment . ''
They are both different from pythons because pythons can swallow an alligator .
Also , from the student 's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are .
The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA .
Unlike the python who is a generalist who can live anywhere because food is abundant .
This occurs when the cell dose n't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane .
He finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and Paul looks up to him for that .
But once he got to college his friends were n't there to help him out anymore .
Both the Chinese pandas and Australia koalas are specialists .
He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing .
Lastly , you need to know what temperature to store them at .
This tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information .
He was the same as Pual .
Then the next section explains what space junk is .
He starts with an attention grabing introduction .
First , I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container .
The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability .
^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial .
Thirdly , you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment .
The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk ?
Invasive is the right word to describe these actions . ''
So , Paul took that in as something that he could do .
They move on to what really is 'space junk ' .
And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm .
A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability .
Type D stretched the same length in test one and two .
^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure .
These small pieces can cause damage , because of the rate of speed that they are moving .
The second topic he has listed is crash course .
Three trials can help make this definite .
Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams .
Different amounts of vinegar would give different results .
The articel being organized helps the reader stay interested and understand better .
white : : The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors .
Without these you can not replicate the experiment .
When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened , he felt for him .
The panda and the koala eats only a certain type of food rather than everything .
b . )
Active transport requires the cell 's energy and exports things out of the membrane .
Mr. Leonard ca n't read but was a very good athlete .
Pandas and koalas are both endangered animals .
Because when she is talking to her aunt she didnt want to tell the truth and hurt her feelings .
Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency .
The last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are .
Diffusion does n't use energy to move substances .
This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is .
Neither of them can read very well .
^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length .
There was an indepent variable , the type of plastic , and there were multiple trials .
Plus if it is a cold winter , t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer .
Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him , he can be just like him .
In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar .
The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing .
They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable .
This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother .
The control should be either stretchable or very durable .
The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion .
Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt .
There similar because most species are abundant and they do very good around humans .
'It 's time to start your training . ''
You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in .
The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial .
He would help him overcome his obstacles .
Those tiny fragments in space traveling at 5 miles per second can destroy a space shuttle .
It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early .
Cells also use osmosis , where water moves froman area of lower concentration to an rea of high concentration .
Rose is carimg .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are : what the article calls specialists .
So its a just right roof .
The article is organized with a title and sub-headings that emphasize the main points .
The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk . '
He then goes into why the problem is dangerous to astronauts and space shuttles .
white : : The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse .
Which would cause the dog t o overheat .
Based on the students data , Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm .
He continues the article by describing how space junk got into space and what it is .
This shows she is atleast giving it a shot .
It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type .
The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place .
pandas consume bamboo which grows naturally only in China .
The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table .
'Anna , ' Rose said 'Whats wrong ? '
a .
The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction , and three sub topics .
And finally , I need to know if it is weighed in grams , pounds or any other measurement .
^p 2 .
She is really caring and sincere .
The least amount stretched was plastic a .
He catches your attention , then gets serious .
Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar .
Therefore the students should specify the marble , limestone , wood + plastic .
Rose is hardworking , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm ( 1st trial ) and 23mm ( 2nd trial ) .
They are helping each other with the things that are holding them back .
I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment .
Also to have the same weights of each plastic .
That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid.4 .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat leaves and plants .
Based on the student 's data , plastic A stretched the least amount .
The author has a very effective way of organizing the the article .
4 .
From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch .
This chain will be a protein .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist for their countries .
Aunt Kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work .
By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning , we could see the change that occured .
I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading .
Finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do .
If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results .
rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed .
How much sample to add into each solution .
Paul discovers some information about Mr. Leonard when he is given the URL for the track and field website .
Both these animals are different from pythons .
This shows that she cares about how other people feel .
In this section it says 'In 1957 the soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite . '
No other school wanted a runner who could n't read .
They also say to let it sit for 24 hours , where should it sit ?
Finally , they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data .
The author of 'Orbiting Junk ' organizes the article into four sections .
This quote shows China panda 's and Australia 's koala bears are similar because they mostly eat one thing .
Type one is passive transport .
She is a compasionate and caring person that cares about others .
In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis .
This is easy enough to tell from her reaction when Anna walked into the room .
He was very happy for him .
Finally , the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry .
Rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school .
Then the author provides the reader with a specific example of how harmful and serious space junk can be .
In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
I think that Mr. Leonards ' background information has a big effect on Paul .
There are many plots that can support the point , among which one detail is predominant .
Anna said , 'Money is n't everything . '
There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it .
Rose is caring and wants to help people .
That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics .
( 2 ) The mRNA is then read by the ribosome .
Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch .
The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be .
First , knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space .
he also realizes that those two are very much the same , because they both are n't good at reading
By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard 's past , he feels more accepted and normal .
After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment .
^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length .
Also , a control group could be added .
Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently , making the experiment inaccurate .
How much vinegar to use .
The auther orabizes the article in sections .
Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount .
These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes .
What kind of containers ? Big small ?
^p 2 .
One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container .
black : : The doghouse will be warmer .
Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment .
When Mr. Leonard came along and helped boost his confidence .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring .
I knew them well -- feelings of embarrassement ... ' .
Some form of passive transport include osmosis , diffusion , and facilitated diffusion .
When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him .
The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial .
This is because white does n't attract as much heat .
He is touched by the fact that Mr. Leonard took his time to coach him into being better .
I do not , however , believe these results are valid .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading .
Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me .
I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size .
a . )
'It 's time to start your training . '
Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard use to be a record breaking member of a track team .
After that he explains what space junk is and where it comes from .
According to the students data , type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest .
^P B .
Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from .
You broke records .
Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should 've included how much weight .
Make sure the plastics were all the same length .
Also , they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate .
^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in .
You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup .
I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample .
He organizes it by sections , by 3 different parts .
So to me I think black would be the best color .
They then move on to overviewing what 'space junk ' consists of , and how it came to be .
Based on the student 's data , plastic B stretched more .
'Soon I realized what I could do for him . ' C'mon , Mr .
The author organize 's the article with different titles to represent what they are talking about .
Lastly , you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at .
In the Febuary of 2009 , two satelites , one American and one Russian , bith collided with eachother .
The code AUG means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis .
explains space exploration and how man-made objects are in space orbit .
^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample ( when it go inside - absorb ) .
While pandas eats bamboo , koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four .
a ) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic .
When Paul heard that they had something in common and he knew how to relate to him .
The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration .
Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp .
Next is the evidence of the danger 'sapce junk ' can make in 'Crash Course ' .
This makes understanding the information easier .
b .
To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results .
The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control .
'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading .
From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest .
Another is , what kind of containers do they want us using ?
This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar .
.
Then , he states some startling statistics to explain how dangerous spage junk really is .
I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph .
The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment .
Also , the students could have conducted more trials .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used .
Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students .
He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete .
One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials .
I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same .
Then talks about crash couses that has happened out in space and the materials is still out there .
Paul shows this by saying ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard .
Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit .
That is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell .
b .
Mr. Leonard is very supportive and Paul is no longer embarrased about his situation .
The article is organized in a chronological way .
Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights .
After the coach explained himself , paul knew how he had felt , him being in the same situation .
Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy .
Also what size container should be used .
The author begins his article with an attention-grabbing introduction with the shocking exclamations .
A .
She is caring .
You would need the size of the container , amount of vinegar used , the types of samples .
^p b . )
One trait that best describes Rose is responsiable .
A ) In conclusion , plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial .
Next , the author begins the section called 'What is Space Junk ? '
This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color .
3 .
Another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell .
A trait that Rose shows in her conversation with Aunt Koleb is caring .
It can eat a variety of things , it can change .
The student did a good job conducting this experiment .
I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone .
Rose is determined .
Rose is caring and does n't like to upset others .
First in the beginning two sections he describes what space junk in and how it is a problem .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard 's experience .
light gray : : This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature .
Then they get let down because the 'comet ' is n't a comet , it 's a tool bag .
A cell 's membrane is selectively permeable .
You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant .
With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold .
This information encouraged Paul to strive in learning to read .
I need to kind the control group indipendant variable , dependant variable , control variable .
How tiny debris can be a big deal and cause a mission to fail .
And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski ' could n't read that good himself so they had something in common .
Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her .
To make this experiment 's procedure complete , three additional things are needed .
Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours ?
1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2 .
That would make the hypothesis more true .
You also need to know what the conditions are made out of .
For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable .
The Author oraganizes this artices very well .
And pythons can kill many different species causing problem unlike a panda or koala .
One trait that decribes Rose would be caring .
Paul feels that Mr.Leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either .
balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic .
( 'She felt too young for so much responsibility ... imagining how her brother must feel . ' )
As the article said , snakes are endangering five species in Florida keys .
That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white .
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star he wonders why he is n't anymore .
It 's very vague , so they should add more specific .
Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both specialists .
Invasive in this article used because those animals were never meant to travel from one area of to
It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples .
They should have told us what to measure the cup with .
Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane .
Paul was in school and could n't read .
One movement process is called osmosis .
The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention .
Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records .
Type A only stretched 12 mm .
They organize it by making up sections .
A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment .
It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems .
It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal .
The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him .
In diffusion , substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
When Paul confronts him , He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read , Like himself .
white : : The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside .
According to the data , plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic .
Obviously , it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article .
This clearly shows that Rose is caring .
Paul knew what he was talking about .
Paul is empathetic towards Mr. Leonard and vice-versa because of their similarites .
The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42 ( DEG ) with the white lid .
^p 3 .
He then wants to coach Mr. Leonard in reading like Mr. Leonard coached him in track .
white : : This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors .
Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane .
How much vinegar should we put in the containers .
Then the author describes what space junk is .
The author organizes this article in a simple , yet effective way .
The author breaks the article up into smaller sections .
Based on the student 's data , we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability .
The author organizes the aritcle to explain everything in order .
The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked .
Section one is the explaination of the story .
The introduction is very attractive .
In her conversation with Anna , Rose sees that her younger sister is upset .
In order to replicate the experiment , the person performing it should do a few things differently .
Paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website .
You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it .
Paul ends up finding out the his track coach , Mr. Leonard used to be a track star .
Plastic type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second .
The chain that is created is a protein .
The author did a really good job of writing this article .
And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least , meaning it 's more durable .
They require a very specific habitat to live .
The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using .
She is taking a job that conflicts with her school work jsut to help put paul through college .
The mRNA attaches to a ribosome , to begin protein synthesis.2 .
The student 's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable .
They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length .
^p 1 .
B ) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both require special native food .
She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really does n't on the inside .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus , it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome .
But experiment D have the same type of stretching .
Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency .
He feels as if all the help Leonard has given , he should return some of it .
Rose is very mature for her age .
The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using .
First , mRNA leaves the nucleus .
The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics .
Osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell .
And the last paragraph 'Little Bits But a Big Deal ' explains why space debris is so important .
white : : White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat .
They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials .
As a young child , Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning .
In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type .
The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add .
This needs to be included in the procedure .
Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm .
In this group 's procedure , they do not state what
'Rose did n't answer .
It 's the stretchiest .
Before certain paragraphs , at the left-hand side is a bolded subtitle .
black : : This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors .
By doing this it keeps the article organized and easy to understand .
The author talks about how satellites collide in to eachother and produced space debris .
The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane .
^p 2 ) Compare their results with another group .
^p 3 . )
You feel okay ? '
^p b .
Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator .
each section is wsell informed and organized .
Unlike the python which they dont have a problem with migrating and adapting in other environments .
It should have a constant mass for each of the samples .
Next , the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1 .
The author organizes the article with main points about space junk .
It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers .
He flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read .
Osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell .
So it just showed Paul that he should n't give up just because something gets hard in life .
They could have repeated the experiment more , to validate their results .
`` Based upon the given data , I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability .
The information Paul finds about Mr. Leonard on the website is surprising to him .
What he learns about Mr. Leonard gives him hope and makes him want to work hard for Mr. Leonard .
It 's a comet !
What do they measure length in .
Paul sees that he 's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read .
Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial .
Also , to improve validity , the student should have had the same starting length of plastics .
The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention .
Paul is sempathtic and wants to help Mr.Leonard to read .
Secondly , how much vinegar should be added to each sample ?
The movement of particles through a membrane with the concentration gradient .
What type of vinegar and does temperature matters .
According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A .
Also , they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic .
The data shows that in both trials ( T1 and T2 ) , plastic B stretched 22 and 23 .
Lastly it is important to know how much of each substance to use .
A good procedure would have specified this
'What is Space Junk ? '
The author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs .
Specify how much vinegar in step 2 .
A ) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1 .
Lastly does it matter the material of the container : glass , metal .
This is because they are not used to having pythons there .
A ) From the data , I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable .
This shows how serious the problem is .
In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know what the samples were .
He follows up with a section called 'What Is Space Junk ? '
I would also need to know how big each sample should be .
`` A ) In conclusion plastic type `` '' B '' '' could stretch the most .
He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he ( Paul ) was feeling .
Then how she has to work to help support her entire family .
One process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis .
You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star .
Next , the author describes what space junk is , and how it was created .
These things are all very important information that was n't included .
A . )
The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested .
The next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships .
black : : The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter .
You feel okay ? '
I would need to also know which type of container to use .
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material .
In the story Rose asks Anna , 'You feel okay ? '
Maybe her life would get easier .
State how long you are rising the materials in water .
Then he puts a subtitle on the next subjects he brings up to keep it very organized .
He was good in a sport but not so good as a student .
a .
This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating .
Causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense they 've been dubbed `` '' invasive '' '' . ''
An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance .
How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde .
This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship .
white : : The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside .
These two species are different from a python because a python is a generalist species .
white : : brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray .
I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this .
Paul is happy an shocked at the same time .
Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given .
The first topic he talks about is what is space junk .
1 .
Lastly , we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period .
^P B ) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the same that they are both specialist species .
He organizes it by first getting the reader 's attention by using shocking statements in the introduction .
For both trials preformed , type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm .
He realizes that after all that Mr. Leonard trained him to do he should help him in return .
Another process if diffusion , which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration .
It also show how people can help other people .
After this they tell you about how two satellites crashed into one another causing space debris .
Both differ from the Pythons , Who snacks on rodents , birds , and the occasional alligator .
( A ) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched .
If there is one sample that is shorter than the others , the results will not be accurate .
One trait that Rose has is thoughtfulness .
It stretched 22mm in trial one , and 23 mm in trial 2 .
To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container .
Also , they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers .
They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails .
I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well .
The first process is possessing a passive transport .
2 .
However , once introduced here , they can survive and thrive in the southern U.S .
Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus .
white : : the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot .
Whe he does , he discovers that Mr. Leonard was just like him .
MacInnes believes that the term invasive is unfair because `` '' they 're introduced .
In addition , I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used .
After defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made .
First , in the product it just said pour vinegar .
I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container .
These animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist animal .
The author organizes the article with titles .
And Australias Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves and us ' also not harmful like the panda .
he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this .
Then , tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome .
a ) My hypothesis , that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct .
As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome .
He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic .
`` Pandas and koalas are both specialists .
Rose is very caring .
I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups .
A specialist can only live in one place where as a generalist can live almost anywhere .
I would need to know how much of each material will be needed .
'Rose did n't answer .
How much vinigar must be poored into each container .
He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records .
Paul now understood more things about his coach .
Also , they could have used a different amount of weight .
Paul decides he 's going to work harder in school and at track .
The author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by 'Grab your telescope !
Mayber her life would get easier . '
They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic . ''
She fell asleep while working on her essay .
This background information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him .
This takes more energy from the cell , and may use enzymes to quicken the process .
Also , the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic . ''
To the lowest te mperature , 41 ( DEG ) C for the color white .
Also the article said that a python can live anywhere as a panda/koala cant .
Also , we need to know what type of environment we should place this in .
And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data .
The similarities between pandas and koalas is they do n't eat meat .
In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14 .
One of these traits is she has never complained about helping to pay for Paul 's college education .
Generalists favor change unlike the specialist .
Paul is very thankful towards Mr. Leonard for helping him get faster .
1 .
One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis .
The author organizes the article by catching the reader 's attention then informing them what space junk is .
It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris , it 's ANY object .
If you use more of one sample than another , then of course it is going to way more .
Pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in China .
Next , they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
The procedure left out some information that is needed .
Simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient .
Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane , but it does not require energy .
In the store it states pythons are imperiling live endangered species in the Florida keys .
What is Space Junk ?
During the story , Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past as a college hurdler .
Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr period , or do you just leave them uncovered ?
Things such as temperature are necessary .
The author grabs the readers attention in the beggining with the phrase 'Grab your telescope !
Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money .
1 .
The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self .
suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
The first section is the introduction , where the author provides a brief explanation of space junk .
and Crash Course .
The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons .
But because it 's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter .
The author organizes the article well , by putting information in certain sections .
They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live anywhere .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala bear are similar because they really do n't each much .
You would need to know how much wood , limestone , marble , and plastic you would need .
We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers .
Even the term `` '' invasive species '' '' is unfair '' '' .
to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about .
As the article states in paragraph 11 , the snakes have imperiled 5 endangered species in the Florida keys .
This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane .
Rose seems very caring and compassionate toward others .
The first section explains the main purpose of the aticle .
So he asked him about it .
What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying .
For the plastic C and D , they are inbetween and C is close to A .
Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of .
white : : White is a very light color .
This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up .
In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first .
First , I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass .
Also , it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard .
Finally he concludes by saying that the space junk will continue to increase until a solution is found .
^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
After that , the author describes how satellites 'die ' and crash into each other , creating microdebris .
The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner .
He wants to repay him for all the help Mr. Leonard gave him .
The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment .
He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star .
The author first talks about what is the Earths autmosphere can handle and what we may see out there .
'What Is Space Junk ?
The author starts with a introduction .
The author organizes the article by putting it into specific sections .
Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul .
thing this
Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2 .
Paul could have helped Mr.Leonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling .
Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane , but it does not require energy .
In conclusion , plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples .
Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him .
Based on what three bases you have in each segment , a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid .
they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar .
The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane .
That Rose is a thoughtful girl because she would n't tell her aunt something that would hurt her .
The author then writes about how it is harmful to space and our environment .
It also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard .
2 .
Finally , the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table .
They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed .
When i get low to the ground .
a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b .
They are different because pythons eat all different types of food .
In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability .
A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable .
And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used .
Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons .
Pandas and koalas are specialist species .
Also , they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2 .
Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid .
The author gives a sequential order , and provides detail with each subject .
Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he could n't read either .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial .
At the start of the procedure , we would need to know what four samples we were testing .
This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was .
All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein .
Then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk .
This proves that black absor bs the most heat .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman .
You could also do the time at different times .
This simply increases the respect he has for him .
'Crash Course ' and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay .
The author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of .
This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical .
For this to be a valid experiment , we would need to use the same amount of vinegar .
It was easily the longest .
^p 2 .
The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck ?
Light ?
Maybe it would n't .
Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data .
You broke records . '
Paul wanted to know why Mr. Leonard would want to keep such accomplishments a secret .
You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions .
To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing .
I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial .
While she works she still keeps up on school work and helps her aunt cook for the family .
Paul thought that Mr. Leonard went to college , but he was wrong .
They rinsed each sample with distilled water .
Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top .
The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm .
She does n't want to tell her aunt because she might tell her mother or hurt her aunt .
Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability ) .
He was once a young boy , and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have .
So they have to stay in specific habitats to survive .
That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight .
An example is in paragraph 19 'Rose did n't answer .
You would need a scale to measure the different containers .
The second section , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
It was n't as strong as it should of been on the second trial .
It 's time to start your training . '
The third is called Crash course .
Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most .
The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used .
The author starts off by giving background information about junk that orbits in the 'Orbiting Junk ' headline .
They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial .
Next , we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material .
One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials .
But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they do n't eat everything .
One trait is caring .
Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities .
A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion .
This repeats , with the amino acids joining together , eventually making a protein .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' means to intrude and perhaps disrupt .
Additionally , the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container .
Pauls learns that Mr. Leonard could n't read , just like him .
The author organizes this article into sections with titles with an opening paragraph to grab the readers attention .
These both come from plants .
The anti-codons are joined by amino acids .
' I ca n't read . '
Also , it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar .
Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read .
The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA .
He could identify with the embarrassment he felt .
Exocytosis .
Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is , 1 .
He then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head .
Panda bears eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves .
The background on Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul .
In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem . '
One trait that describes Rose is understanding .
Her conversation with Anna shows this .
Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment .
Then her aunt realized that the family relies heavily on her and tries to make it easier on her .
This is proven by the data gathered by the trials .
It exploded , but it still tried to eat it .
In addition , there is an information about how they determined the mass .
With passive transport , the cell wo n't have to use any energy to move the substance .
' ( paragraph 38 ) .
`` The word , `` '' invasive '' '' plays a very important role in the article .
The author starts out trying to get your attention with what may in the sky .
The sub-paragraphs give it away .
I can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister Anna .
Therefore when he ( Paul ) learns of Mr. Leonard 's past he feels a relation between them .
The way the author organizes this article is that he uses a very eye cathing thesis or opening statements .
It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container .
Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before .
'Rose did n't answer .
This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him this .
the author explains what a satellite is and how they function .
The students should be more specific in giving the directions well .
The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine .
Also , the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container .
He finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact .
The next section titled 'Crash Course ' , explains the affects of having free-orbiting disabled satellites flying through space .
Now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read .
They could have also repeated the trials .
These results are valid because of the two trials , so I can confidently conclude this .
a .
`` Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading .
In active transport , the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane .
The tRNA then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the tRNA .
Next , the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother .
He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment .
An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis .
He keeps it simple , but also interesting for the readers .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic .
Then they talk about the satellite collision between the Americans ' satellite and the Russians ' satellite .
One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment .
Active transport is also used .
black : : Black absorbs light .
no other school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
THAT PROVES SHE CARES FOR HER FAMILY AND IS A KIND AND CARING PERSON IT DECRIBES HER .
But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20 , still being close to B .
Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose .
Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept .
The scientist feels the term `` '' invasive species is unfair '' '' , referring to pythons .
Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp .
Invasive species are animals that are introduced into an envoriment and thrive in it possible affecting other animals .
3 .
One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container .
As a opposed to pythons that eat meat .
Based on the results , plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable .
Also , if Paul succeeds , Mr. Leonard does too , since he taught Paul everything .
'Anna , ' Rose said .
Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C , D , and B .
After reading the groups procedure , I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring .
In paragraph 38 , Paul lists his acheivements as a track star .
This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat .
The author organizest the article very well .
America is being invaded and steps in stop it need to be taken .
Finally , the last section is 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
' , which explains whats happen over the past 52 years .
To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting .
They are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything .
They eat only meat while the koala and panda do not eat only meat .
This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out .
Then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information .
In it , the author explains how 'space junk ' is concerning government agencies all around the world .
Rose seem 's very stressed , but she handle 's it very well .
These two animals require certain factors in their habitat .
For the lowest color , white , it was 42 degrees celcius .
Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials .
In conclusion trial any
He organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you .
He was very organize and got his point across .
^p b ) To improve validity/design , the student could have conducted more trials .
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard struggled reading , he was confused .
Secondly , how large should the samples be ?
Anna says , ' I 'm so lonesome for Papa .
Plastic B can stretch the most .
In order to complete the experiment it would be necessary to know what the four materials actually are .
You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same .
He seperates it into different sectoins such as What is Spacr junk ?
The author organizes this article by breaking it up into four parts .
What were the weight of the weights that were used .
They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples .
white : : The color white is the best choice .
Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample .
and he said , ' I lost my scholarship and flunked . '
Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it .
Line 1 : 'Grab you telescope !
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist .
How long to rinse it in water ( materials ) .
The coach gives Paul a website to look at .
when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color .
The author organizes the article by putting specific ideas together .
3. containers size .
In paragraph 39 , Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard 's success .
I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples .
The first main section , titled 'What is Space Junk ?
They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them .
Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length .
He really connected with Paul when he told he couldnt read .
Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles .
Active transport requires energy , this may use transport protiens .
Beaker , test tube , a regular container ?
In the story Rose is a very giving person .
Rose does n't want to hurt anyone 's feelings .
part , you would n't understand what space junk is in the next two sections .
You feel okay ? '
As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab .
Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic .
I see Rose as a caring girl .
They could have added more weight in the second trial .
Also having the same measurement size for each plastic .
They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic .
Than last he talks about space trash .
Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup .
They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2 .
and Crash Course
Then , the author talks about how dangerous it is when objects in space collide .
In paragraph 14 , a python had swallowed an alligator .
`` `` This shows that both animals are specialists and they eat food that come from plants .
Also , he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew .
The author organizes the article into four major groups ; the introduction , 'What is Space Junk ?
Without these 3 main information points , nobody could replicate this lab .
the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse .
He organizes it by topic , such as what is Space Junk ?
Rose cares deeply for her sister .
It gave Paul the bright idea to help Mr. Leonard read .
When Paul first discovers the shocking new information on Mr. Leonard , he is a bit confused .
The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections .
The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first .
He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college , that he even broke records .
In the end of the story , Paul takes Mr. Leonard to help him with his reading disability .
The author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts .
Pandas and the koalas both are herbivores , while the python is a carnivore .
A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used .
This paragraph defines Space Junk and explains how it is formed .
The author organizes it into three different sections .
Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past , he is in shock .
D stayed the same .
Others believe those species are truly invasive because they are disrupting the biodiversity of the environment .
^p b .
Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information .
The author organizes the article in order to create a detailed introduction , explanation , and conclusion .
He tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box .
Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands .
After the realization of Mr. Leonard 's past , Paul wanted to help him .
It shows Paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life .
1.How much vinegar & how big a container ?
And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water .
Then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened .
Paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help Mr. Leonard .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they both walk on legs they both eat bamboo and leaves .
One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability .
The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be .
China 's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo .
Paul has empathy for Mr. Leonard .
`` According to the results , polymer `` '' A '' '' is the strongest .
Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials .
Lastly , he tells us that little bits of space junk can have a big impact on spacecraft .
Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman .
She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college .
In the story I obtained information about Mr. Leonard .
^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers .
The author separates the article in 4 different categories .
The Burmese python living in the wild is now found in the U.S . ''
After that , the author explains three different problems that space junk creates .
Also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like Mr. Leonard .
Additional information I would need to know would include several things .
I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul .
Ehen Paul was reserching on Mr. Leonard , he found out the he to , could not read .
b ) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways .
Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less .
The amount of vinegar needed is essential information .
How much vinegar and the students pour into each container .
The procedure is unclear .
C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between .
One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion .
' ( paragraph 40 ) .
She asks her sister whats wrong when she walks in rubbing her eyes .
It 's a comet !
The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard 's favor of teaching him to run track .
The author organizes this article into different sections that explain about different things .
Finally it does n't say how long the sample should be rinced for .
This means they have more places where they can survive .
Anna sincerely cares about Paul and her little sister , and wants to go to college herself .
A trait Rose has is that she is understanding .
They do n't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples .
Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane .
For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A .
The author organizes this article by splitting the topics up .
Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read just like himself .
The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched .
Then he explains space elxploration , then talks about satellites and finally explains the danger of space junk .
They should describe what the samples are , how much vinegar do you put in each container .
The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him .
:
For plastic type A , the amount stretched increased by one mm .
^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water ?
Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup .
There for it stretched the greatest amount .
The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors .
Plastic A only stretched 10mm ( 1st trial ) and 12mm ( 2nd trial ) .
When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes .
The word invasive when the tain approving bear in the article . ''
Paul does n't feel so alone anymore .
Section two talks about what space junk is .
Paul is inspired by the information about Mr. Loenard because he to has a reading disability .
This is what makes them different from pythons , because pythons are generalist species .
At the end of Paragraph 45 it reads , 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm .
What are the four different samples ?
Pandas and koalas are both specialist and need specific things to live .
black : : Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black .
Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times .
When paul found out that Mr.Leonard was an amazing college track star paul was amazed .
The author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things .
Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second .
I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used .
the student could 've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm .
You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container .
It can even distory spaceships .
To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers .
The author puts thihs information under a section called Crash Course .
The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest .
Unspokingly Mr. Leonard has gone through the same trouble that Paul is currently facing .
It requires no energy , so it is called anerobic .
For this experiments duplication , you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup .
This shows that both animals are specialists because they would n't survive in most environments .
They end the article by describing how the bits of fragments can cause the Earth and satilites big problems .
Which shows that Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
The student should have told , how heavy the weights were .
Paul realizes that he is being coached by an expert .
Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they depend entirely on their location to survive .
The author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space .
The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium , and have everything balanced .
he/ she talks about space junk and how it effects our admisphere and the rocketships in space .
He organizes this article by breaking it up on diffrent topics of the same subject .
You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples .
I also need to know how much vinegar is needed .
Rose is an optimistic person .
One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk ' the author answers just that question .
The author first starts off with an interesting introduction by providing rhetorical statements like 'It 's a .
it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere .
Rose is veryunderstanding .
-In step 1 , we need to know what samples .
As for white is would get the least amount of heat .
Pythons are different because they are generalist , meaning they can survive different conditions .
Plastic type C and D are in the midle .
First , the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article .
By the out come of this experiment , you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest .
The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles .
He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read .
The panda and the koala both are specialist species .
the second was .
The next section , entitled 'What Is Space Junk ?
You need to know whether it should be in a cold , wet environment or maybe warm & dry .
In the trials , the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as .
White ended up about 42 ( DEG ) C while black was about 53 ( DEG ) C .
^p ( 3 ) How much of each sample to use .
The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure .
The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times .
The need to have his own question .
It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star .
They grab you attention and make you want to read the rest .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least .
This makes them a very effective invasive species , as described in the article .
This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane .
Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something .
To the different samples were listed in the procedure , it would be betterunderstand .
Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse .
Where do the samples go to sit and dry at .
Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It 's time to start your training . ' .
The author organizes the article by first stating that space junk can be dangerous .
An example from the article is `` in the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator ''
Paul asked 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
white was on averge 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than black .
In the conclusion section , the author wraps up the article with the main problems space junk poses
' , 'Crash Coarse ' , and 'Little Bits , But a BIg Deal ' .
Rose believed that if she told the truth it would hurt Aunt Kolab 's feelings .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes .
Based on the students data , plastic B stretches more than the other plastics .
It really depends on where t he people live and on the season .
After that he gives you a few references to some accidents that relate to his topic .
It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they 're both specialists .
1 .
Paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete .
They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in ) .
An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The
I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be .
Like in the second sentance of paragraph 23 she said 'maybe her life would get easier ' .
None of the other plastics had stretched as much .
Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period .
After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college .
A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in .
This gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article .
Rose is considerate .
Make a control having the clamp ( without weight ) be measured .
The next section 'What is Space Junk ? '
The author has three sections in his article .
You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup .
How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water ?
They are different from a python which is a generalist and eats more than one type of food .
Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great track runner in college .
Dark gray has trials that are 48 ( DEG ) C which is hot .
You need to know how bigof a container .
She works way too much to where shes falling asleep doing her work . '
The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control .
She asked this to Anna , even though Rose herself was n't well .
^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
white : : White is the best color to use for the doghou se .
Lastly , plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm .
( 1 ) .
Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school .
First , how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers ?
He had to go .
tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3 .
Paul can sympathsize with Mr. Leonard because they are both not very good at something .
Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading .
The author gives an example of when one American and Russian satellites ran into each other .
The author organizes the article with facts of 'space junk ' that are in space due to space exploration .
They both ca n't , or have trouble , reading .
She is also protrayed as very realistic .
Their are three things wrong with this procedure .
This shows risks and what could happen .
Paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he ca n't read .
This makes python generalists & pandas and koalas specialists .
She did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the Aunts feelings .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
She wants her family to be well of and live a good life .
Lastly , at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight .
He decides to help Mr. Leonard overcome his obstacles just as he did Paul 's .
Paul was surprised at the information he obtained regarding Mr. Leonard 's past .
Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane .
They also could of hard more plastics .
She puts that second though .
When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was , that inspires Paul .
He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place .
From the experiment , plastic type B came to be the most stretchable .
The author had three key points that were intended to be explained thoroughly .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
that the containers were stored at for 24 hours .
This is how they could improve .
In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly .
'It 's time to start your training . '
They are different from pythons because neither of them eat meat and also pythons are generalist species .
Rose is a caring person .
What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers .
' , explains how disabled satellites can become junk orbiting the earth .
Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well .
To begin , the author grabs the reader 's attention with an interesting introduction .
These include ; What Is Space Junk , Crash Course , and Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
You would also have to know how big in size each container was .
Also the size of each sample .
This would ensure which plastic is the strongest .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy .
it made him respect Mr.Leonard even more becasue they were alike .
This brings a closeness and a sense of empathy to Paul .
This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane .
Next we have Crash Course , which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites .
`` The word `` '' invase '' '' describes how pythons are becoming an invasive species .
The background information influences Paul to push himself .
They 're both good athletes who have trouble reading .
Specialist can only live one areas nway in contrast to generalist who can adapt and live almost anywhere .
a ) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types .
^p a .
One prcess is the use of the semi-permeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell .
One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure .
Paul feels he can relate to Mr. Leonard .
Also , the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched .
^p B .
One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure .
In the way that they both just eat mainly one type of plant .
`` Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists .
So we can see how far the plastics stretched , and how many weights were used .
This keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information .
He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him .
The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees .
Paul was surprised to fing out that Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
The author starts with background information of what space junk actually is and what happens to the junk .
Also , there should be more specific size measurements of the containar .
In fact he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and borke many of records .
The author organized the article by using an introduction what an attention getter to get the reader 's interest .
An example of this is when she is talking with Anna and says , 'Anna , What 's wrong ?
Diffusion is a high concentration to a low concentration .
Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student .
Rose seems to be very responsible .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
Mr. Leonard sees a lot of himself in Paul and that reminds him of how he used to be .
Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically .
Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it .
for the way she trys to take care of her sister and does alot of work for the family .
They both only eat one kind of food , bamboo or eucalyptus leaves .
white : : white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot .
inside jar after 10 min .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup .
^p b .
The author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences .
To replicate the experiment , the first thing that a group would need is a control variable .
I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism .
In the end they both bettered the other and a way .
It 's time to start your training . '
The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard .
You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment .
In order to replicate this group 's procedure , I would need the following information : ^p 1 .
Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane .
This will make the procedure easier to follow .
Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel .
black : : Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm .
a ) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most .
section 'In 1957 , the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite . '
No nother school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers .
Lastly , It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him .
A ) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability .
' , Rose is giving Anna the hope of going to college and having a successful life .
One detail from the story that shows this is when her sister walked in rubbing her eyes .
Rose is hopeful in the story she realizes maybe her life would get easier .
This has an overwhelming difference of 11 ( DEG ) C after JUST 10 minutes
Pandas are similar to Koalas .
Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup .
Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane .
She keeps working towards a better future for her family and herself .
Lastly , the third section tells the aftermath .
Leonard is a role model of Paul
Type B though , streches the most .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
What are the samples ?
It should say what each `` '' sample '' '' is in the procedures .
he never knew how to read .
the reader gets background on Mr. Leonard from a track website that the Coach gave him to look up .
^p b .
Paul could n't believe it .
' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
That 's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done .
He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete .
They also talked about there grandpa moving away and how its been hard on them both .
It also determines Paul to do better in school and track .
What is space junk ?
the light gray was average 45 ( DEG ) C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter .
Lastly , I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic .
b .
At the end of the stroy , Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training .
Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane .
It only stretched 10-12mm .
The first section just explains that there are things in space called 'space junk ' .
The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding .
The author organizes the article into different aspects of 'space junk . '
4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment .
This membrane is water soluable .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they do not favor change a basically eat one food a day .
And koalas only eats eucalyptus leaves .
Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B .
This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it .
Their food source is only found in their home place so adapting to other places would be extremely hard .
A ) In conclusion , plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material .
Therefore , this article is neatly organized in 4 different sections .
Active Transport is one of the three .
One trait that can decribe Rose is caring .
Paul feels a connection to Mr. Leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1 .
When Rose is talking to Anna , she shows that she is selfless .
( Were the samples completely covered ? )
Rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like Mama .
This also encourages him to push himself to be able to read better .
Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell .
You 'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used .
When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds .
The author organizes this article under different headings .
Rose is a caring person .
Meanwhile , there are pythons exploding because they try to eat alligators .
The word invasive is crutial to understand the article .
and he wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading .
Then they start to bring out facts and statistics .
Next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things .
You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results .
Instead , you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity .
How much vinegar is needed in each dish .
The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul .
It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister , Anna Whats wrong .
He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is .
the first section is the introduction .
The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure .
He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read .
Just like paul .
They are not native to America , and they are invasive because they are taking over the environment .
So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
( Paul , P 45 . )
B .
It changes the way he looks at Mr. Leonard .
The article states that both animals eat a certain food present only in their native environment .
Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read .
That would keep the doghouse warm .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment .
It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be .
It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story .
In the experiment , it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size .
If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected .
First , the amount of vinegar would be needed .
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that Paul has in life .
The author begins with an introduction that grabs the reader 's attention by making a shocking statement .
Get it rig ht .
But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm .
He concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk .
They are new animals that threat biodiversity .
a ) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics .
You would also need to know how they determined the mass .
Measure the plastics during the process of stretching .
Also Paul finding out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star has a big effect .
in jar before starting exp .
Rose being nice and not wanting to hurt her aunts feelings did n't give her an answer .
1.A list of materials and safety requirements .
white : : white would make the dog house less hot .
So , that is an inspiration to Paul .
He follows this by presenting a potential problem that arises with this topic , appropriately named 'Crash Course ' .
Crash Course , follows , talking about how even minor 'space junk ' can be a huge threat .
Osmosis- The process by which water is moved from a high leel of concentration to a low one .
Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read .
The author also continues to use headings to demonstrate diferent parts of the article .
During the story , the reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard .
Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard did n't tell him about how good of an athlete he was .
It is all under the main Topic , Orbiting Junk .
Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard ca n't read , like Paul .
They both rely on eating just one thing , bamboo or eucalyptus leaves exclusively .
At the end of the article the author tell the harmful effects space trash can cause .
In knowing Mr. Leonard 's background information , Paul feels like the two can relate now .
Pythons eat almost everything and are extremly harmful .
I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container .
The author starts by getting the reader 'excited ' .
The author organized the article in a unique way .
and black averged 53.25 ( DEG ) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white .
Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both animals do best around humans .
Invasive in the the article means that any species controling the habitat + endangering other animals is considered invasive .
In able to have the experiment preesse .
Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is .
There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside .
Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul , i think Paul understood more .
Paul understood what Mr. Leonard felt like .
Also they could 've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial .
Pythons can adapt to many diverse climates .
Paul takes Mr. Leonard to teach him to read at the very end of the story .
They are similar because they are both specialist animals .
However , endocytosis is a form of active transport .
a .
One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working .
They are then held together by a peptide bond .
The author starts on a somewhat fast pace , trying to grab the reader 's attention .
They also should named a common value for all the weights .
Overall plastic A is the most durable .
Last , I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period .
Then telling you wat makes the space junk .
She is understanding of the family 's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it .
The information gives Paul motivation to never give up on school or athletics .
the doghouse would not likely be made of glass , a nd sealed off from outside air curculation .
A trait that describes Rosa is caring .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Crash Course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind .
( a ) The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm .
These are the introduction , a section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
These students could have improved in a lot of things .
Through this data recorded from the experiment , we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup .
Also , the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers .
Then it needs to state how much of each `` '' sample '' '' .
He didi n't know how to read and he was only good at track .
Immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what 'space junk ' is .
Both the pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are very similar .
so black would be the best colo r
The information made paul want to become a better athlete and reader .
We would also need to know what kind of container they used .
Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are .
Based on the student 's data , you can conclude that plastic A streched the most .
In the article pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Paul was surprised .
Like Paul , Mr. Leonard was not a very good reader as made apparent by his college background .
It is important to keep your constants , constant .
This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit .
A ) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials .
Rose feels as if she is being overwhelmed with everything she has to do .
Rose is considerate .
They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials , and have the plastics of the same lenghth .
The author organize his artivle very well .
this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp .
first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere .
Mr. Leonard stays after school even longer to help Paul .
Also , you would need to know what size and shape the samples are .
He or she also uses subtitles such as 'Crash Course ' to explain a few extraterrestrial crashes .
For each codon , there is a complementary amino acid .
a ) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic .
1 .
When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard 's struggle to learn , Paul feels a connection with him .
They are different from pythons .
You 'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample , and what the samples are .
Rose is optimistic about her future in life .
All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment .
This shows that Rose is a loving person and respects others .
Chinas pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because as the author states in paragraphs 19-21 they are specialists .
Therefore , it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams .
`` Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both specialists .
Pythons are generalist .
Step 6 , but they don ; t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf .
paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard 's words , they were all to familiar to Paul .
They organize it into subject matter : 'What IS space junk ?
I would also need to know what temperature .
Space junk is pieces of debris from various space crafts and such .
She is very determined .
When she talked to her Aunt Kolab , it had said 'Maybe her life would get easier . '
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read either .
We do n't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used .
Their both different from pythons because pandas and koalas are both furry and pythons have scales on them .
In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information .
He was suspicious , so he decide to ask Mr. Leonard .
It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials .
Panda in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist .
That is how he organizes the article .
Pythons are generalists , pandas and koalas eat only one thing .
He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read .
Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard .
Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid .
The paragraphs are titled by what it is going to tell you .
Plus they are both track hurdlers too .
The material also that not include in control groups .
Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure .
`` Panda 's and koala 's have similar ways to animals life .
I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get .
Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far .
The author puts 'What is Space Junk ? '
The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab .
In the same way , Paul wishes to assist Mr. Leonard to achieve something .
On the other hand a python is a generalist .
Paul undersands now why Mr. Leonard pushed him to reach his goal .
You would also have to know where you 're leaving these containers .
Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away .
Koalas only eats eucalyptus leaves which grow natural in Australia .
Koalas & pandas differ from pythons because a python is a generalist & pandas and koalas are specialists .
The way that pandas are similar to koalas is that they both only rely on one food source .
In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included .
A ) The conclusion isthat , plastic type B has more stretchability than the others .
A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain .
Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard did not know his name .
The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container .
Each article is different making the reader able to understand it easier .
It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be .
Others believe they are invading places like Florida were they should n't be . ''
A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog .
Paul is amazed that the hall monitor at his school used to be a track star .
The author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article .
The paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there .
And Rose helps Anna .
The website tells Paul that Mr. Leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college .
There are many ways that the group could have improved their design .
^p b ) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial .
Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain .
Without the table , a lot would n't be known by looking just at the procedure .
The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B .
As he imrpoves in the hurdles he is asked to join the track team .
And then he gose and showes him how to read .
Unlike pandas & koalas , a python eats whatever it sees , for example , one ate an alligator .
The students could have conducted more trials ( which could have improved the experimental design and validity ) .
Finally the author describes how tiny fragments can hurt .
You feel okay ? '
The reason she cares about her is that Anna is Rose 's sister
white : : The best color for the dog house is white .
1 .
He/she does this by using exclamation and question marks .
Rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok .
Mr. Leonard explains that he could n't read , and that he flunked out of college .
These 3 changes to the procedure , will make the experiment easy for replicate .
Lastly , i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples .
In the introduction , the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way .
The student could have used more plastic .
They have chosen one main point , which is space junk , and created a few subtopics .
Since Mr. Leonard helped him , he will help Mr. Leonard .
Rose says to Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
Based on her conversation with Anna , Rose can be seen as mature .
The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples .
Paul also is a little confused on how Mr. Leonard didnt make it as a runner .
Where as pythons have been known to swallow an alligator .
This man had given me his time to help me excel at something .
He won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuonals , but drop out of college .
It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate .
This is how koalas and pandas are similar and differ from pythons . ''
Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar .
By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one .
I say this because in trial 1 , it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm .
Paul also has a hard time in school .
To conclude the polymer investigation , according to data , plastic A is the Stretchiest .
One character trait that describes Rose is thoughtfulness .
The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2 .
The author organizes it in a way to make it easily understandable to the reader .
He first starts out with the introduction to be interesting , to get your attention .
Doing more trials to collect more data .
The author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage .
1 .
Paul was grateful that Mr. Leonard had given his time to help him succeed at something .
Their is active transport , passive transport , and then their is gradient transport .
In order to replicate the experiment , i would need to know a saw things .
The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials .
One trait that describes Rose is understanding .
Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested .
The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard .
After the titles the author goes into further detail under each topic title .
and specify the size and type of the containers used ( beakers )
Then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs .
Ex .
One trait that describes Rose is respectful .
I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be .
The background informations effect on Paul is that it inspires him .
As long as the climate is right , they can adjust and find food .
^p 3 .
1 .
The author organizes this article intofour smaller articles that all have an overlying topic that is 'space junk ' .
^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic .
When Paul asks 'what happened after that ?
Osmosis- The diffusion of materials through water particlesActive transport- Moves materials by using energyPassive transport- Moves materials without using energy
For plastic type D , the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same .
Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye .
Problems like 'disastrous holes ' .
You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same .
I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours .
3.diffusion when
Mr. Leonard was a star in college and wanted Paul to suceed .
And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment .
In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard .
The final section explains the dangers of space junk .
This allows the reader to always know what 's going on and somewhat outlines the entire article .
The author of this article organized the paper logically .
^P b . )
white : : I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature .
They are different from the python because pythons eat almost anything .
If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties .
After Paul learns of Mr. Leonard 's past , he is curious and surprised .
Rose can be described as caring and considerate of others ' feelings .
white : : White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse .
During that paragraph he talks about satellites and what happens when they die or malfunction .
In order to replicate the lab , the students did you would need to know what materials were need .
A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified , as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution .
She tries to be the mother of the family for her sister Anna .
It means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both furry mamals .
It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place .
In the next paragraph they are saying how the Space Junk even gets there .
The students can add more more time for the weights to hang .
Cells use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane .
Therefore th e dog house should be light grey , it is a happy medium .
Therefore , states that Panda 's and Koalas are different .
white : : The best color to paint the dog house would b e white .
Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard .
In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used .
being sent into space , and how therefore space trash is increasing .
They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples .
More information would be needed to replicate the experiment .
The United States followed suit , and thus began the human race 's great space invasion . '
After reading the groups , I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment .
The author starts off the passage with a comical line , 'Grab your telescope !
is 53 ( DEG ) c if the dog likes it hot in there
Then , the mRNA enters a ribosome .
Python are generalists .
First man to make it into college without knowing how to read , that should be a great accomplishment .
First , the mRNA goes to a ribosome .
Plastic type B was the most stretchiest ( 22 & 23 ) & plastic type A stretched the least .
How much weight am I supposed to add .
Based on her converstation with Anna , Rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person .
Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school .
He starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk ' .
She says this to try to comfort her sister who is upset about Papa leaving .
The protein channels allow certain things to come through .
white : : It Was The Coolest With the Temp .
Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him .
The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth 's atmosphere .
He one ate a alligator .
Then the full strand is split , and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated .
He had nobody to help him .
you also need a control group .
He begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader .
The reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding .
She puts her family first in everything she does .
When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
B stretched on average 22.5 mm , while the other three ranged from 10-20mm .
In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are .
Mr. Leonard could n't read either and he could n't get very far in his life .
The students can able more trials to their experiments .
In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was capable stretching the most .
Pythons can live in many places but koala and panda have special needs .
this data states that plastic B was the strongest .
They also could have done another trial for more accurate results .
The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3 .
The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by : 1 .
Two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching .
Such as earth , wood , limestone , and plastic and how much of each to put in .
Pandas and koalas are very similar , they both have a strict diet .
^p b .
Finally it explains that tiny bits of space trash is not a big deal .
The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic .
Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low .
They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container .
There is a connection between them .
It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture .
Finally , the temperatures of the room , where the solutions sat , needs to be known .
He then changes his tone to that of a more formal one .
The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard ; sympathy .
This makes them different from the python because the python eats a wide range of thins . ''
It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter .
What kind of container ?
She shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and Anna .
Type A stretched the lease , in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm .
He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard .
Paul now understood that he could overcome his problems to and become a hurdler like Mr. Leonard .
In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material .
^p b ) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used .
Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6 ( DEG ) C average .
For example each could be a foot long .
He does n't feel out of place .
Generalists eat more than one type of food and can adapt to the environment around them .
white : : The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature .
Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard and Paul wants to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard .
Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard felt when he had to read or did n't know answers .
They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well .
The author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers ' eye .
His first actions are to inquire about his coach 's former accomplishments .
Also , what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ?
if I were Paul I would be honored that a former track star was willing to work with me .
Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results .
But when talking to her Aunt , she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go .
So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read .
^P 1 .
So Paul says ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
'What is Space junk , ' 'Crash course , ' and etc .
She is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members .
The author organizes the article in a 'opening support conclussion ' format .
None of the other plastic types stretched as much , Plastic D one the closest at 20mm .
The ammount of added weight should be specified .
to describe what 'space junk ' is .
white : : By painting the dog house white , it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler .
The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container .
Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard .
Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees .
Next , there are 2 paragraphs about crash courses with the title of 'Crash Course ' .
Rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has .
The author organizes the artical by subtitles .
These opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful .
In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another .
Having read the article before it , we know why this can be a terrible occurence .
Next , they talk about the damage space junk can do .
Rose is a caring person .
Those who support this statement would consider the python invasive . ''
Paul must feel proud of being coached by one of the best track stars .
'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
But then when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading .
I need to pour on each of pour seperate , but dentical containers .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past , Paul feels like he can relate to this .
Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most .
In order to replicate this experiment , I would need to know many details .
So if the roof is white the dog will too cool .
This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school .
I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure .
As the author continues through the essay , he/she adds factual information on the hazards of space debris .
Lastely it talks about how loosing space trash is serious matter .
Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something .
Even though it 's a rough situation , she 's looking at what good can come out of it .
Therefore , a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray .
white : : it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there .
The plastic type B had stretched the most .
First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader .
Rose is very hard working and caring .
She works all the time just to help her brother .
Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A .
Then the lab would be performed correctly .
Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he was n't a good student .
So Paul asked him 'What happened after that ?
Then the article has seperate subtopics which state important details relating to the subtopic .
He still should finish his college and get his scholarship .
white : : If the dog house is white , then it will be co oler .
Also the amount of vinegar they used .
The author categorizes this article .
If they wa nted the temperature to be warm , they would paint the doghouse black .
The author for example talks about an American and Russian satellite colliding into each other .
The author makes everything build upon each other .
Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights .
She did n't answer her aunt because , she did n't want to hurt her .
and he was disapointed thet Mr. Leonard hadnt told him about this before .
Also , i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor , what is the temperature .
It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well .
Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it did n't work it was still to hard for him .
Then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter .
They need these specific things to survive .
First , it starts off how every good essay starts off .
You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment .
Unlike the python it relies on many .
a . )
An probably her aunt would tell her mother .
However , on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable .
She is considerate of her family 's feelings and their situation .
In order to replicate the experiment , the group of students need a control .
But the specialists ( snakes ) can remain in the same environment .
'Rose did n't answer .
Rose did n't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings .
It 's a meteor !
According to the article .
I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment .
Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples .
plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm , the furthest .
The author begins by creating the introduction , showing the beginning of space exploration .
'What 's wrong ?
The last paragraph is title 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate .
( Joel Achenbach ) .
Plastic B was the most stretchable .
The group could have also included information about the vinegar 's temp , which is an important constant .
Finally , the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something .
a .
This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane .
It 's a comet !
Also , they should 've used a control plastic to compare their results to .
( a ) Based on the students data , plastic type B is the 'stretchiest ' plastic .
He can relate to him in the way that he ca n't read very well .
You feel okay ? '
Her family needs money and their papa 's new job paid three times the salary of his last job .
Firstly the author grabs the readers attention .
^P More trials need to be done , at the minimal , three .
The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way .
Also , Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard .
It shows Paul that school is important .
Anna does n't understand why their father has to be away in Los Angeles .
Both listing what topic they are writting about .
a .
With more trials , the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate .
The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool .
C stretched the second least ( 14-13mm ) and D closely followed B ( 20mm in stretching ) .
The author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit .
`` Some additional information that would be needed are specific things .
They also conclude that the space junk is making space missions more dangerous .
Then he goes into the past , giving the reader a sense of history .
After that he breifly explains the space age in what is space junk .
The student also could have been more specific in their procedure .
Mr. Leonard had reading problems when he was around Pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports .
From that point on Paul helps Mr. Leonard with his reading .
white : : The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature .
The fourth is called Little Bits , but a Big Deal .
Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information .
Paul helped Mr. Leonard , just like he had helped Paul .
The student could have included how much the weights weighed .
Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete .
if she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
The author uses 'cause and effect ' to organize the article .
Paul is actually lucky .
He did n't understand why the coach had kept that from him .
You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample .
If they were n't all the same size the results would be inaccurate .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
He then explains other topic like Crash Course and other little things that fly in the air .
This experiment is not valid because the number of weights is n't given .
The author organized the article with an inroduction and a body .
The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp .
He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades .
The significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem .
Paul now looks up to Mr. Leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles .
So it can live in a wide variety of places , such as Asia and the U.S .
Both the panda and koala are specialists .
What temp is everything ?
^p b ) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific .
^P b .
The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something .
She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings .
a .
Also , the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in many ways .
white : : I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house .
What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used ?
Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis .
It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm .
Third , the author discusses how satellites collide with each other .
Paul had the same problem , he couldnt read also .
The ligh ter the color , the cooler it will be inside .
Also , pandas and koalas are warm blooded and sakes are cold blooded .
Rose is not living an easy life .
They both have essentially one type of food , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
When he confronted Mr. Leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce .
But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard did n't do well in school .
Rose is very caring .
My conclusion is that , based on the data , plastic B has the most stretchability .
Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class , but he was extremely embarrassed .
tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA .
Fourthly the say why such a little thing can be a big problem .
Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type .
To keep data acorte .
white : : The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool .
Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min .
light gray : : The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup .
The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk .
Pandas only eat bamboo , and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Right now , one can only guess what weight that was .
At the beginning of the story , Paul is having trouble in school .
The introduction has a clever beginning to draw readers in and then the rest becomes more serious .
But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt .
I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most .
Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is .
b ) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control .
Of course they do , so that 's one .
They could of repeated the procedure one more time .
The author starts off the article with a catchy introduction .
Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be .
She did n't tell her aunt how she fell because she did n't want to hurt her feelings .
in darkness outside ?
He wants to know more about him .
They are not carnivors like pythons .
Rose asks how Anna feels , she would not ask this unless she cares about her .
Paul wanted to do something for Mr. Leonard because he helped him with hurdles .
`` A0 I conclude that plastic type `` '' B '' '' has the highest amount of stretchability .
For example , step 1 should say : `` '' Take 5cm of one plastic type . '' ''
The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog .
Rose is caring .
If its bad or not .
They could 've put little or a lot .
It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least .
^p B ) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side .
The students need to include what the samples were .
A .
The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis .
Rose talks to her until she exits to bed .
Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic .
and the next section is 'Crash Course ' .
Paul seems very suprised that Mr leonard was a track and hurdle runner .
^P b ) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails .
After copying the DNA sequence , mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother .
The additional information that should be included in this procedure is .
Maybe her life would get easier .
Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient , without the need for energy .
a ) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm .
They should 've also done more trials on the other types of wrap .
Python are a generalist species so they can adapt to places that are not ther homeland .
The author organizes the article by sectioning it off into groups so we can understand the material .
Paul is not exactly an average boy , he does n't really fit in and he can not read .
Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it does n't state .
Paul 's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better .
^p B .
Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching .
Paul is concerned that Mr. Leonard did n't tell Paul about his track career before .
Arguably this animal can live anywhere and can eat a variety of things .
They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it .
She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab .
The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps .
It doesnt really effect the back ground so much
Paul first learns that Mr. Leonard won the four hundred meter hurdles at nationals and broke records .
She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding .
The author organizes the article into three condenced topics about orbitting junk .
Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest .
For example , it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk .
The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used .
Also , we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples .
Each section gives information about what happens .
The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes .
Second , I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup .
Mr. Leonard 's past also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read .
In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm .
And I would also need to know what shape the samples are .
Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray would n't be too hot or cold .
Also , it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label .
Another is How much water to use when rinsing it .
It changed by 2mm .
He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment .
He still answered Paul .
you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample .
The author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk .
Also increase the weight in the second trial .
After that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal .
Once the rRNA reads a codon , the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4 .
white : : the dog house will not be to hot .
They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps .
The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him .
She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister .
'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
during her talk with Anna Roes says 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college . '
Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area .
Then plastic type S , then C and finally A , which has the least amount of stretchability .
Other information
When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids .
`` The entire article is about the threat invasive species present to an environment .
In order to replicate the group 's experiment I would have to know more information .
( ie grams , pounds , ouples )
The panda & the Koalas are also both herbovores that eat mainly 1 exclusively plant .
This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results .
The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard .
Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient .
black : : the color black heats the doghouse the most .
In ( T1 ) it stretched 10mm , and in ( T2 ) it stretched 12mm.^p b . )
A .
The author 's conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do .
Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard , because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed .
Koalas , the article states eats eucalyptus almost exclusively .
I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container .
The invasive species invade and are n't imbalance in ecosystems .
How long the samples , how much the vinegar , at how big should containers be .
Also , I would need to know what material to put in each container .
You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material , for example plastic could
After learning of the background information , Paul feels more connected to Mr. Leonard .
just like humans .
' .
^P b .
So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite .
( line 21 ) Rose nodded .
By doing this I believe it makes the article more effective and easier to read .
The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him .
Each section has a main focus , but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris .
It also allows the reader to know where specific details come from and find them very quickly .
She tries to make sure her sister is okay in paragraph 5 .
) .
The highes t temperature was 53 ( DEG ) for the black lid .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals , and he took that opportunity .
Next the author explains the danger of the main topic mentioned in the introduction .
^P B .
Therefore , painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog .
a .
I would also need to know the problem to this experiment .
Because Mr. Leonard flunked , he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed .
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome .
And state how much weight is being added to the plastic .
First he talks and informs us about the general idea of Space Junk .
For example , Rose said to Anna , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information .
A python is a generalist .
First , you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup .
a ) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type .
When he found out that Mr. Leonard also could n't read , he understood how his coach felt .
A python swallowed an alligator . ''
The author starts off with an exciting introduction , that very much grabbed my attention .
white : : The lighter the color , the cooler the dog wil l be .
a .
Finally , I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass .
He then goes on to explain what 'space junk ' is .
Crash Course .
The procedure is very vague .
Students can improve the design by having a control so that they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable .
The auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
Based on the student 's data , it 's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest .
If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse .
she is hard working all the time .
the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions .
The author organizes the article by breaking bits of information down into it 's own section .
The United States followed suit , and thus began the human race 's great space invasion . '
Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched .
All of the following are to condense the article into areas that focus on those specific ideas .
As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one .
Therefore , one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful .
Also , when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool .
Rose cares about others .
Does not tell her that she is .
The author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the reader 's attention .
Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading .
After reading the groups procedure , I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment .
it tells us some starter facts and other things .
She seems like she is overwhelmed .
It effects Paul , because he can relate to Mr. Leondard 's story .
Paul felt sympathic .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
Plastic A was the least stretchy .
The author uses an 'attention-getter ' at the beggining of the article to draw readers in .
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species .
First he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea .
If one plastic has more weights than the another , it will make this experiment not valid .
a ) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two .
Underneath the title 'What Is Space Junk , ' he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is .
Also , to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container .
Earth is not used to the rapid change humans have brought that lives complicated an environments niche .
You broke records . '
This organization technique is common in information essays .
Their different from pythons because pythons eat other animals .
In the What Is Space Junk ?
Plastic type A stretched only 12mm , therefore it stretched the least .
I can also conclude plastic `` '' A '' '' has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm .
The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it .
the author gives a bit of information on what he/she is about to be talking about .
The background information gives Paul a sense of connection with Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes the artice by putting the information into three different sections .
After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him , he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out .
a .
This show Paul 's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things .
Also in the table include how much each weights were added on .
this help him to practice runnung and he help Mr.Leonard to practice reading .
Next the author talks about how space junk can be created .
Both are different from pythons because , pythons are generalists , who can live in most climates . ''
This is different from a python .
To know how much vinegar to use , 2. what is the control , if any and 3 .
Also , the student could have named the type of plastics .
This trait is evident in paragraph 19 ( sentences 1 and 2 ) .
I would also need to know what I am measuring the mass in , grams , etc .
During the story .
Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent .
Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome .
One kind act to another is exactly what has happened .
The author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is .
In the other two subsections , they are once again organized by topic .
When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot , it can sleep outside .
First , the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification .
Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least .
Specialists ca n't seem to come together and agree . ''
The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him .
They both have trouble reading .
Lastly , i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment .
Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology .
Also , how much vinegar should we pour , and in what sort of container ?
The author does a great job explaining the way that the space junk works in outer space .
Pythons can eat almost anything , and they will eat anything as long as they get their food .
The group was n't very specific , for example they did n't say what temp .
This makes the article very easy to read and to understand .
In the second paragraph , the author defines space junk and uses the history of space junk .
The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself .
One way the student could 've improved the experiment is to add another trial .
This is similiar to Paul 's situation .
A ) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility .
black : : Black will absorb more heat , therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
It 's a meteor !
In order to replicate this experiment , i would needed to know the different types of samores .
Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics .
-Also specified how high up the table was .
Determine what type of containers are being used .
Mr. Leonard 's story has a powerful effect on Paul .
Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read .
There diets are just completely different .
A ) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
Rose can be described as a hard worker .
Facilitated Diffusion : The passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy , working against the gradient.3 .
^p 2 ) The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar .
She is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school , even though she is exhasuted .
How much vinegar should be poured into cup ?
Paul soon realized that Mr. Leonard was a superb athlete , but was not the best student .
But with black i t attracts the sun .
Then talks about all the different space crafts used in the past 52 years .
So would need to place something in regular water as well .
The last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal .
An example of this was when the python ate the alligator .
This group is lacking a control group in their procedure .
This would make the experiment valid when reproduced .
He could of also told how heavy the weights were .
It also means that while breeding , these pythons are attacking and endangering the native wildlife .
This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem .
The author starts off by telling us what space junk is .
The effect that background information has on Paul is that he has someone who can empathize with him .
One trait that can describe Rose is respectful .
The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54 ( DEG ) C , the color black .
Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much .
This is how pandas and koalas are different from pythons .
In order to replicate this experiment , additional information is needed .
The panda and koala are similar because they are both specialists .
The word invasive is particularly important to the article because it describes foreign reptiles in America .
The background information helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard .
He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles .
Paul can feel the emotions that Mr. Leonard is feeling .
Litlle Bits , But Big Deal talks about how it does cause a problem for the arstronauts and spacecraft .
They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much .
Lastly , he or she talks about small issues that are a big deal .
Lastly , they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking .
Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure .
It helps him to better understand Mr. Leonard .
Pythons are diffrent because they are a generalist species .
Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment .
Secondly , they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp .
^P b ) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic .
Rose says 'It 's only been four months , He had to go .
`` I would include the materials used or the `` '' samples '' '' .
And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best .
Paul is very shocked by what he see 's on the internet about Mr. Leonard .
3 .
Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material .
Plastic type B has the most stretching ability .
She is responsible .
You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle .
Hopefully they can both learn to read and help eachother along the way .
Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2 .
^p B .
As a result , pythons and other generalist species thrive in this day and age .
'you feel ok ? '
He starts out telling what space junk is .
Is conclusion , plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less .
The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something .
The section Crash Course refers to the event of a Russian and American satellite 'running ' into one another .
This is because , on average , it stretched 22.5mm in length .
Mr. Leonard 's history shows Pail what he can become .
allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence .
What is space junk ? , Crash course. , and Little bits , but a big deal .
The student could have done more trials .
Both pandas and koalas are specialist species .
`` In the article , `` '' invasive '' '' is perceived by people as having two different meanings .
The panda needs to eat its bamboo and the koala needs to eat its eucalyptus leaves .
Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials .
This would definitely improve the validity of their results .
A last step should also be included to say repeat .
He wants Paul to achieve success .
This means they consume lots of things that an ecosystem needs which makes said area less diverse . ''
Then he goes into what space trash and space junk is .
By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid .
The author organizes the article but using sub titles and paragraphs .
The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA .
Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did .
This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic .
The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer .
Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner , and that he broke many records .
The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard changes his views .
Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch .
In the story Gifts , Paul finds out information about Mr. Leonard that he never told him .
The author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph 'What Is Space Junk ? '
If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily .
Then it tells you how satellites crash in space .
This information gives Paul a whole new view of Mr. Leonard .
To replicate this experiment you would need the following information .
The author organized the article by trying to catch the reader 's attention first .
`` Panadas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they mainly only eat one type of food .
The third and final section in about little pieces but a big deal .
The effect that background information Paul has about Mr. Leonard is astonishes Paul greatly .
Another way is by facilitated diffusion .
More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons , which produce a growing polypeptide chain .
A ) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials .
Paul wants to help him , just as he helped Paul .
She realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed .
First , a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA .
Rose is very caring about her family .
All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount .
However , Aunt Kolab is very understanding and talks through the situation with her niece .
^p The type of container for each substance .
Paul follows directions and finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past .
Koala bears and pandas are very much alike .
Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but did n't know how to read .
Paul is inspired by the fact that Mr. Leonard , a great athlete , is training him .
Rose is a sympathetic person .
^p B .
The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard .
Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in .
Paul finds reading hard ; so does Mr. Leonard .
Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane .
They do n't have a control to show how the others were affected .
Another improvement wold be more trials .
white : : The best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white .
In T1 , A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm .
He says he knew the feelings well .
Pandas eat bamboo , and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Mr. Leonard 's background effects Paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self .
When her little sister Anna says , ' I 'm so lonesome for Papa .
She did n't want to hurt her aunt .
this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house .
The author tells us that Mr. Leonard smiled sadly after realizing what it was .
Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors .
Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell .
Paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either .
Plastic type B was the stretchiest , while A stretched the least .
Rose did n't answer .
These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design .
In closing , the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem .
In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest .
Having all plastic pieces be the same length .
`` Pandas and koalas are both similar because they can only survive in certain areas .
I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm .
Mr. Leonard could n't read and he wanted to make something of himself , just like Paul .
I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass .
He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
When he questions him , and finds out the truth , he says , ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard .
In the article it says that the pandas mostly eat bamboo and koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves .
1 .
The author has organized the article by using headers and titles to sort the information .
This is because the results are inconsistant .
One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3 .
the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary .
Paul quotes 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards wrods were all too familiar to me . '
Little did Paul know , but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner .
I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours .
The author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next .
Not only that plastic type , B , was the strongest , it stretched the farthest too .
He was amd excelent athlete but just like Paul , he struggled with learning and reading .
This process requires no energy.3 .
When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3 .
Are the different containers made of the same material ?
This paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous .
`` Koalas & Pandas are both animals that are becoming extinct .
So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading .
the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane .
It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing .
Most pandas are found in China and most koalas are found in Australia .
This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal .
^p B ) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are .
Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student .
The Author organizes this article into sections/questions for each topic .
On average about 6.6 ( DEG ) C cooler , compared with the averages for the other lids .
Then in the section 'What Is Space Junk ?
Now Paul wants to keep running , and help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
It holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky .
The pieces are so little but yet so powerful .
There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white .
You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain .
Secondly , it tells you the risk and chances of satellites colliding with each other .
The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues .
Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon , the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed .
Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister .
Then they go on by describing what space junk actually is .
Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment .
When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard 's background , he instantly begins to look up to him .
In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial .
He tells of the variety as well .
First , I would need to know what type of material is being used .
Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials .
The backround information effected Paul because they both had things in common .
They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container .
As this occurs , ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein .
First , the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it .
One trait to describe Rose is loyal .
They can go anywhere and eat anything .
Biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an unfamiliar environment .
He describes many of the passages by showing what can happen .
He gives you the background , or history , of Space Junk .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a trackstar in college .
They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in , Light/dark , warm/cold .
Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup .
If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability , I would choose B .
She says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic .
He understands why Mr. Leonard has been helping him .
Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following : ^p 1 .
Then they talk about how satellites can collide with each other .
Type C stretched 14 ( mm ) on the first trial and 13 on the second .
Also I would need to know where I should place a sample .
Also , step 3 should be switched with step 2 .
Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest .
The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer .
On the website he sees someone he has grown close to .
Paul finds this to be surprising .
She cares fro Paul .
1 .
A ) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic .
They need to include marble , limestone , wood and plastic into the first step .
Conclusion ; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C .
The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops .
In his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2 .
The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on .
You feel okay ? ''
It also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem .
Paul feels like he needs to help Mr. Leonard after what he did for Paul .
Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could n't read .
it then goes to the ribosomes .
Therefore , Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background .
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler .
Lastly , they do n't give the names or amounts of each sample .
The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul .
Both animals live almost exclusively on a single food source , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
Space junk should not be considered a minor matter .
Rose can be optimistic'Rose kept nodding .
The Chinese panda and the Australian koala are two specialist species .
Seeing her like that made her worried about her and asked what was wrong and if she felt alright .
Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard and make him feel better .
Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog , and therefore making white the right color .
Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag .
a ) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap .
Pandas in China are similar to koala in Australia because they both herbivores .
Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space .
She is caring .
Each section presents a different problem contributing to the build up of space junk .
She thinks the best of each situation , and hopes and dreams that things will get better .
The author organizes the articles by putting them in categories .
The first part of the artice he uses the word space junk .
In the second step how much vinegar should be poured .
Rose is compassionate towards others .
black : : White would keep the doghouse the coldest ( ar ound 40 ) .
First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about .
After that the author explpains the threat of microderis fields and the effects they can have on space missions .
In step 1 , they say `` '' determine mass of four different samples . '' ''
Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability .
dark gray : : It will be warm inside the doghouse , but not too warm .
They also do n't say how much vinegar should be used .
When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made .
Lastly , plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2 .
There is also no indication when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples .
But if you were to use black or dark gray , it would keep the dog house warmer .
Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house .
Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul .
Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
After that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth .
Paul seemed shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner .
Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard .
`` There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment .
He feels a reason .
Thirdly the author explains how satellites collide in space and become 'space junk ' .
Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun .
I t hought it might be too hot for the dog .
The author organizes the article into different sections that fall under the appropriate headings .
This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy .
^p b ) .
.
After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis .
I would also need to know the measurment .
This shows compation and caring .
'It 's time too start you training . '
The Koala 's almost eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
The Space Junk title is starting of by saying there is actually Space Junk .
The author organizes this article very well and it 's easier to understand .
`` Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
This section tells the reader , in detail , or how dangerous space junk can be .
and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest .
They start off with an introduction that catches the reader 's eye .
'Little bits , but a Big Deal ' is informing us about those articles combined kind of .
( Results in the feeling of something ( pain , heat , cold . ) )
^p B ) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for .
'Anna , what 's wrong ?
I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more .
He met a school coach , began hurdling on Mr. Leonard 's track .
One trait is that Rose is a caring person , that loves and respects her aunt .
Mr. Leonard is embarrassed for flunking out of college .
The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment .
The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves .
Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials .
Well as we see on
He was curious to why Mr. Leonard had not ran anymore after that .
The first three paragraphs get you hooked into the story and make you want to read more .
Mr. Leonard 's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar .
It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared , stronger .
Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him .
This does n't give the readers anything to compare the results .
black : : the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy .
section explains how space capsules , satellites , and teloscopes explore space .
Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunkred out of college simply because he could n't read .
They then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is .
Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2 .
Then , I would need to know what the three samples are .
He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles .
It 's time to start your training . '
Passive transport does not require energy , the molecules just pass through the membrane .
Rose is loyal to her family .
In step 2 they do not say the size of the container , they just said you need them .
He sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing hurdler , and he did n't even tell him about it .
So , Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul .
Cells can also use diffusion .
They are invading southern territory and knocking out endangered species , such as the key largo wood rat .
Panda 's in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because Panda 's eats almost nothing but bamboo .
The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul .
Rose is a very helpful person and does stuff that will help other people .
Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
Also the amount of weights you add one .
Paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards Mr. Leonard .
Third , you need to state the size of the containers .
The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein .
Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do .
You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup .
The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next .
Amino acids link together and form a protein
We only have the two lengths after they were stretched .
Otherwise , the data can be affected without this constant .
The author organizes the article in different titled sections .
'What is Space Junk ' is where he basically tells us just a general idea about it .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records .
a : Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics .
a ) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest .
example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black .
The author organizes the article one step at a time .
`` The word invasive describes how dangerous reptiles are becoming , invasive through out .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
I think the author did a fine job with organizing this article .
Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis .
The author organizes this article into diffrent categories .
When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped .
Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common .
The introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here .
This is a very good way for the author to present their information .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane .
She cares for her family .
Thease are some key things that need to be included .
Based on the student 's results , the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B .
The author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment .
One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial .
Based on the student 's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount .
1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2 .
For example `` '' a python swallowed an alligator , '' '' ''
When the reader gets the background information about Mr. Leonard , Paul was surprised .
The author organizes the article by using interesting facts to grab the reader 's attention .
In the way they are different to pythons .
A ) Based on the data , plastic B was the most strethible plastic .
The python is highly adaptable and can live anywhere with a reasonably favorable climate .
They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic .
For example , the subtopic 'Crash Course ' tells the danger of satellites colliding together .
Say what sample to use in the experiment too .
Also , there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid .
She is always hopeful .
Anna is very caring about other people 's feelings .
So its not all in one combination .
The author begins with an eye catching introduction .
The background information makes Paul puzzled .
The author starts with a shocking hook , which draws the reader in .
The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added .
Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight .
Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm .
Mr. Leonard , although not able to read , was successful at other things including track .
in order to help support the family .
A passive transport uses little or no energy .
`` The group stated to `` '' determine the mass of four different samples .
The author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
assuring , 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college .
Should it be poured limestone , a block of wood etc .
You would also need to know what four samples to use .
In the article it said that a python went into the everglades and swallowed an alligator .
Then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft .
Mr. Leonard makes Paul run laps , while hurdling .
Every weight they add should be the same .
The Panda 's eat almost nothing but bamboo .
Therefore plastic type B is the weakest .
In trial 1 22mm , and trial 2 23mm .
When Paul recieved the background information on Mr. Leonard he saw a connection between them .
With a good hook , to bring readers into it .
Rose ignores the question because she does n't want to hurt her family .
By having all the mass 's the same , it would be easier to determine the difference .
Facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell .
Last , they have Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
They eat only eucalyptus leaves .
Rose didnt answer .
100g or 50g or 10g .
Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else .
^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers .
To replicate the experiment , the procedure would require more detail .
The student should have done another trial and have a control group .
Paul who we know ca n't read turns out to be a great athlete but ca n't read .
I would also need to know to record the data and take observations .
The last little article tells the reader how small but still very dangerous the space junk is .
Based on the students data you ca n't really come to a conclusion because there is n't enough data .
That background information about Mr. Leonard shocks Paul .
He also tells how it is not just something small in space that cant cause damage .
How much vinegar goes in each sample .
Was each sample poured in to .
Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants .
It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided .
In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna 's hopes up .
They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them .
The author closes with describing how dangerous space junk is and that people are trying to solve the problem .
He ws shocked at first because he did n't think that Mr.Leonard could 've ben a track star .
It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used .
We start of with the Orbiting Junk subgroup , which is the opening paragraghs .
You feel okay ? ''
tool bag ? '
diffusion , which lets small proteins in and out.facilated diffusion , which lets larger proteins in and out .
Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA , the strand folds up into a specific protein .
You would need to know how big the containers were .
This type of diffusion requires ATP .
I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular .
It also gives Paul inspiration .
It stretched between 22-23mm .
`` The word invasive , in this sense , means invading the homeland of another and taking over .
According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials .
respectful .
In the categorie called 'What is Space Junk ? '
^p b ) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added .
Lastly , he emphasizes the seriousness of the problems space junk can cause .
What is your control .
If she told her aunt the truth she would hurt her aunt .
The black lid was average 53 ( DEG ) C. it got hotter because the color was darker .
Now a python ares n't live off one food , so it can live anywhere and splecd .
The author then goes on to talk about spack junk and its path and possible collision course .
In Crash Course the author is talking about the dangers of satellites colliding with each other .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Determine the mass of four samples of what ?
The pandas in China and koalas of Australia are similar because they are both specialists .
They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width .
The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand .
We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space .
Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most .
So he feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and decides to help him .
Pythons are different than pandas and Koalas because pythons need to eat more than just leaves all day .
You would need to know what the samples are , how much of each are you would need .
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard did n't mention the fact that he was a college track star .
For example , pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Based on the students data , the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic .
The trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be helpful .
The order is from most shotely to least B D C A .
Panda 's eat nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves rarely .
He broke records and got scholarships .
The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age .
I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment .
Objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts .
Rose also has school , work , and family obligations that she has to take care of too .
You can understand this from her converstation with Anna .
To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things .
One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group 's procedure .
^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at ?
He organize his article in the way he is talking about what is Space Junk ?
The author starts out by telling the reader that a tool bag is floating in space .
Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length .
Many of Rose 's traits are displayed throughout the story .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know : ^p 1 .
An example with details would be , 'The emotions in Mr.Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
Surprisingly , Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized .
^p B .
After reading this experiment there is a lot I 'd need to know .
Mr. Leonard had flunked out of school , and lost his scholarship .
Generalists like change and can live almost everywhere .
Next the author explains the main topic and what exactly space junk is .
The conclusion I got for the lab is that there ca n't be one .
Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics .
They also should add more trials for more accurate results .
Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens .
How long do you rinse the samples ?
Once Paul knew Leonard could n't read that well he decides to teach him as Leonard tought Paul .
He stars with an interdoction to get you intersetes in space .
He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked .
Also there should have been more than two trials .
The first paragraph is a very good attention getter it makes it clear to grab your attention .
Based on the results of the experiment , plastic type B had the least overall stretch .
The first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested .
You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container .
Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both ca n't read .
Rose is having a rough time trying to handle school , work , and everything else .
1 .
First , you would need to know what materials to use as samples .
white : : According to the reults , the lighter the colo r , the colder the temperature is .
Well I would need to know what the problem statement is .
It helps Paul know that he is n't the only one with this problem .
After she says that Rose said that that her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter .
' , consists of information about what 'Space Junk ' actually is .
One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure .
At first , he admires Mr.Leonard .
NSR
After that section , the author writes about different occurances and the details of space junk .
Before all the information can bore the reader , the author changes the topic to Crash Course .
It should also tell you to do repeated trials .
They start out my just explaining what they are going to talk about .
The author organizes the article in sub-headdings .
Pandas and Australia 's koala bears are similar .
When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles he was surprised .
First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers .
These non-native species are dangerous because they often have no natural predators in the new environment and they flourish .
It 's a meteor !
Lastly , they never say how much vinegar to use .
In paragraph 43 , paul mentions that Mr. Leonard went to colleage .
You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used .
Her family comes first in everything she does .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
There is no control so how do you know what water is .
Panda 's from China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both harmful .
You would also need to know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use .
When her Aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this family , she did not reply .
Which would help the dog stay cool .
Invasive species refer to animals/species that was introduced to an area it did originally live in .
He then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk .
A ) In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes .
' , meaning he wants to help him learn how to read .
''Anna , ' Rose said .
Type C streched 14mm in T1 , but in T2 strech only 13mm .
They start off with explaining what the rest of the article was going to be talking about .
a . )
The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on .
The author trys to grab your attention at first .
Type A stretched the most .
He realizes that he is just like Mr. Leonard because they both can not read .
Last , it explains that problems are still existing and the amount of space crash is increasing .
To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
Pandas `` '' eats almost nothing but bamboo '' '' ( Achenbach ) .
white : : White would keep the dog house cooler .
Chinese pandas and Australian koala bears are similar because they 're both specialists .
Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics .
Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most , while plastic type A stretched the least .
In the story , the trach coach advises Paul to look up background information on Mr. Leonard .
Hot , warm , freezing , wet etc .
The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon .
One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic .
It teaches Paul to overcome the tough obsicals in life as Mr. Leonard almost did .
They can adapt to many surroundings and foods .
The next section provides information on the dangers of space junk and debris in orbit .
Both species are specialists- they have adapted to certain conditions & havea hard time with change .
Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane .
One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial .
They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and eat a verity of food .
In step 5 , it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry .
Rose is dedicated , but feels pinned down .
Based on the student 's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Than the author gives his thesis statment .
The author begins with statements that grap the reader 's attention and introduce the topic being addressed .
Rose is optimistic .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome .
First , the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they 're both speciaslists .
Through learning this , Paul is able to empathize .
Mr. Leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read .
a ) From this data , one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
Based on the student 's data , plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid .
One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution .
And also , you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids .
How much vinegar was put into every cup .
Pythons can adapt to many different environment and eat a variety of foods .
First , he explained what space junk was , in the section 'What IS Space Junk ? ' .
The author organizes the article by different topics .
A control ( one with just pure water ) is needed to increase validity .
Rose is hard working .
To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Pythons would probably eat any animal that it sees .
She does so many things to be accomplished that she does n't care how stressed out she is .
The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track .
One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using .
This means that they are spreading through the wildlife while simultaneously becoming a threat to biodiversity .
white : : It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer .
The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way .
Who cant read and flunks out of college , but amazing at track and had scholarships .
a .
The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment .
Paul would pay for Rose and Anna to go to college so that they can get jobs .
Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon , the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond .
Where do we keep the containers ?
Second , they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar .
Mr.Leonard backround information affects Paul because it show paul if you work hard you can reach you goals .
Another is where should the samples sit in sun , or indoors , this may have an affect .
One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar .
The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about .
Thirdly , they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours .
This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family .
These little pieces flying around this fast can destroy a satellite .
Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot .
Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul , and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension .

I also need to know how to find the difference in mass .
Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature .
He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems .
WSR
They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container .
as it said in the r esults , it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree 's Celcius
It needs to be explained what the samples are of .
She asks her sister what is wrong and if she feels okay .
My conclusion would be according to the data shown , plastic B has the highest amount being stretched .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water .
Also must have had the same amount of weights applied .
^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure .
Exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cell.Ion channels .
I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most .
Also , Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard , a difficulty reading .
The also should have had a control , which woud have been the plastic with the weights .
The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting ( mm ) .
After they go out onto the track .
10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because he is not a good reader either .
In paragraph 19 it reveals Anna didnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolabs feelings .
One way they could improve it is to test it more times .
We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
The author organizes the article with subtitles .
What kind of samples ?
The author first begins with an introduction to what the article will be about .
Rose does not want to hurt her family , therefore she is caring .
She worries about her whole family and wants to help make life better for them .
1 .
On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles .
The author organizes the article in discriptive paragraphs .
Looking at the student 's data , you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability .
It makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard would spend the time to coach him .
Neither of them can read and they are both good at sports .
When speaking to Rose , she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation .
Mr. Leonard tells him , ' I was a good athlete , but not a good enough student .
The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident .
When translation begins , the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon .
The text describes a satellite crash that occured in February 2009 .
In the next paragraph we read about crash courses .
The author is very organized in this article .
This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center .
Paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor , Mr. Leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete .
This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl .
Paul has difficulty reading as well , and he was always chosen last for sports .
Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids .
Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial .
They also could have included `` '' record results '' '' in their procedure . ''
This process terminates at a stop codon .
The students could have improved the experimental design !
The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations .
One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in .
'What 's wrong ?
Also , there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end .
You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted , what results where they looking for .
^p b .
A ) In conclusion , plastic B had the most stretchability .
They should of said how much the clamp weighed .
`` These invasive species are considered invasive because they were n't supposed to originally be here .
Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container .
Juggling the two is very stressful at times .
Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different .
They both have big population in their countries and they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves .
and Paul is the same way .
By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible .
Paul asks 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials .
The author organizes the article by having a introduction as being a attention getter .
One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials .
Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell .
The author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things .
The fourth section is titled , 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient .
That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk .
It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes .
^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers .
This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems .
What else is needed is to state the different samples needed .
In the paragraph 'What Is Space Junk ' the author defines what is causing the problem in space .
You would also need to know what the materials are that you 're putting into containers .
Rose is family oriented , she cares about her family .
I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
One trait about Rose in this story is when Rose has a conversation with her younger sister Anna .
The effect that Mr. Leonard 's background information has on Paul is he can relate to him .
He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him .
'What 's wrong ?
In 'What Is Space Junk ' , it described what space junk actually is .
The author sorted the article into four main sections .
No school would take a runner who could n't read .
In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space .
To replicate this procedure , you would need to know many things .
He learned that he had to be determined no matter how discouraging the lack of reading skills truly is .
I prefer this form of organization , as it is easier to read and understand .
These include passive/active transport , facilitated diffusion , and osmosis .
According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside .
But , it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer .
They did not specify how they determined the mass .
To emphasize the seriousness of space junk , he relates facts about real crashes that have occured .
Type C is almost the same firmness as A , and D has almost the same stretch as B .
They both struggled with reading .
If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment .
`` ( a ) Plastic type `` '' B '' '' is made of the stretchiest material .
Also , Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away .
A .
He/she also explains , 'Yet the problem is certain to persist . '
Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment .
Because the temperature and sunlight 's does changes the result .
The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length .
Here , they explain that when satellites malfunction , they become high-tech junk .
Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table .
These sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read .
Also what type of containers should you put the samples in ?
Rose is understanding while having a conversation with Anna .
The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials .
I would also need to know what the samples are .
The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least .
'It 's time to start your training . '
a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample .
Otherwise , we could n't even start the experiment .
A .
^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials .
It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college .
Paul knows exactly what Mr. Leonard went through because he is going through the same thing .
This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time .
The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers .
You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after .
Look up in the sky !
What the four samples are .
The amino acids bond .
It should list the 4 types of rock .
It can use endocytosis , to bring substances into the cell , or exocytosis to push substances out .
In protein synthesis , after the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm .
He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard .
You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water .
Once they went native , they did n't go back .
How it comes bout .
In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest .
To improve this experiment , the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic .
he was shut out because he could n't read .
Pandas from China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they both eat plants .
Paul responds by offering Mr. Leonard 'training ' .
Rose is hopeful .
Roses ocversation with Anna shows that she is mature .
This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color .
They explained what Space Junk was and how it was harmful .
First , mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it .
Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret .
Then , the author explains how it gets dangerous .
The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him .
That 's exactly what happened in February 2009 . '
However , it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell .
above the Earth .
Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material ; in sunlight ?
Rose seems to be a caring person .
Overall , the author did a great job of informing the reader about his point of view .
^P b ) -1 ) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were .
After that , in the the section afer the introduction the author tells how space junk has come about .
The author first starts out with a good attention getter to get you woundering what space junk is .
'What Is Space Junk ? '
^p b .
I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones .
Should the samples be placed in a beaker graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container ?
Her aunt tells her that she will try to do something to make her load easier .
You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses .
The in the section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The background information that paul gets about Mr. Leonard allows him to relate to him more .
Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability .
A . )
Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
Pandas and koala 's , however , can not .
In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container .
a ) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2 .
That is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
Paul onl ; y knew Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor at his school .
The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course . '
I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him .
Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I 've labeled them .
They organize the article into sections that are important and give explanation .
a ) Plastic B stretches the most .
( 5 ) .
The three topics are 'What Is Space Junk ?
So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside .
And two , taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type .
So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint .
This shows a trait of being optimistic .
And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials .
because I do n't know how to read . '
a .
He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
A strand of mRNA can be translated several times .
BobBay MacInnes , a Florida resident and reptile seller , does n't like that pythons are described asInvasive .
He also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution .
The students need to be more specific on their materials .
Then he uses the heading Crash Course to talk about the different crashes between free-orbting satelites in the past .
look up in the sky !
Rose doesnt want to move to Cambodia and her aunt understands that .
light gray : : The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse .
^p b .
This forms an amino acid .
The author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk .
^p b . )
the diffentcies would be 11 ( DEG ) .
Paul wanted to help out Mr.Leonard , just like Mr.Leonard help him out .
Invasive species may become extinct of the introduced generalists . ''
Under the section titled 'What is Space Junk ?
Also they are both good hurdelers .
He became more interested in Mr. Leonard 's past in college .
The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics . ''
This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis : Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water .
^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment ?
Rose does n't like to hurt anybody .
He also wants to return the favor by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read .
It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar .
When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand .
He then explores the topic in more detail , using three different sections .
Rose is caring to others , and tries to help them before taking care of her own problems .
Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm , 23m T2 .
He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle , he still have to study very hard .
In the investi gation , the air temperature of black was at 53 ( DEG ) .
Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot .
Mr. Leonard gave paul some confidence .
Paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort Mr. Leonard has given to help him .
Make each plastic the same starting lenth , and the weights are the same weight .
A cell uses diffusion , osmosis , and transportation .
You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability .
To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data .
^p B ) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic .
The author organizes this article by explaining different problems with orbiting space junk in each section .
Pandas and koalas reguire specific food only found in ther homelands of China and Australia .
This shows that she did not want to hurt the family .
In this section , the author gives major events about space junk and what creates space junk .
Only some substances can leave and only some may enter .
The next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other .
Inside , outside , by a window ?
Obviously , when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul , he saw himself as a child .
So the trait that identified in the passage is that she caring .
He organizes it by putting in a certain order .
Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard 's kindness by helping teach him as Paul learns .
These debris when traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to elite spacecrafts .
He said 'It 's time to start your training . '
This paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth .
One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart .
Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane .
The article is organized into sections .
This experiment is missing too much information .
When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history , Paul could relate .
Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard is still not doing the trck meets still .
After the conversation with Aunt Kolab she was confident that her life could get easier .
One trait that can describe Rose is optimistic .
In the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us .
The group also need to specify what the `` '' samples '' '' are .
Lastly the effect that they are both helping each other .
At the same time Paul could relate to him .
a . )
When she was talking to her aunt it said 'Rose did n't answer .
This connection rises from the fact that they both struggle with reading .
Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement .
They both usually only eat one kind of food : bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas .
He could n't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college .
A ) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability .
Finall , the author tells of ways to prevent the space junk .
The auther defines the problem , giving an examples of space junk .
The article contrasts between two opinions on calling species like foreign snakes `` '' invasive . '' ''
And how much vinegar the students poured into each container .
Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less .
Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples .
Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp .
^p b ) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial .
The 'lifespan ' of debris , so to say .
th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( DEG ) C
Invasive is word that means some thing or someone is intruding on an enviroment , and harming it .
He talks about three very important probles in space .
The introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment .
It starts with 'What Is Space Junk ? '
My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct .
Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
The author organizes this atricle in 4 different sections .
is the foundation of the rest of the article .
white : : White .
The container 's reapetedly , separate but identicle conatainer .
Two , how much of each sample is added to each cup .
After confronting Mr. leonard about the information , Paul says 'Why did n't you tell me about this .
The quote already states pandas and koalas do not like meat . ''
The author also splits the text up into paragraphs that have the same idea .
The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard .
A .
He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic .
Cells can use Passive Transports , which is where there is no energy used.2 .
To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using .
Pythons are generalists , they can move anywhere and adapt to their surroundings to survive .
The author starts off by getting your attention the explaining what space junk is .
Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time .
How many items of material were put into each container .
The author brakes down the article into sections .
Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container .
^p 3 ) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container .
For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic .
1 .
In the procedure , the first step is measuring the length , but i do n't see that data .
My hypothesis was correct plastic type ' A ' stretched the least during the experiment .
And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past , it changes his view of Mr. Leonard .
In the first paragraph , the author mostly explains what space junk is and how it gets there .
'It 's time to start your training . '
It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star .
In the experiment , the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48 ( DEG ) .
Rose could n't answer in fear of hurting her aunt or her mother .
You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers .
That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused .
In the artical , pythons areInvading the American South .
Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard , 'It 's time to start your training . '
Rose seems to be worried about Anna because she comes in the kitchens and immediately asks Anna 'Whats wrong ?
Rose is very compassionate and is always mindful of others .
Leonard ... It 's time to start your training . '
One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork .
Also she cares about her family because she does n't want to let them down with writing her essay .
Rose has respect for her aunt and her family .
The temperature the experiment was conducted under .
Rose is thinking of how she 's going to get to college when her family has no money .
You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample .
She is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family .
Since white had less heat , they would w ant to paint the dog house white .
The author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title .
It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others .
This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard .
Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA .
In each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system .
The author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections .
A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do .
In the third paragraph , the reader talks about the risk of space junk .
optomistic .
In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm .
They are similar because they only eat one type of food . ''
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialist species .
Paul felt a feeling of understanding .
Though it did n't seem like a problem then .
The student could also say how much weight he was using .
Pandas & Koalas are similar because they are both specialist species .
The author organizes this article in a very organized way .
Caring , Rose asks her sister what is wrong , and if she feels okay .
The length of the plastics need to be kept constant .
in the jar the lea st
^p 2 .
Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples .
The author organizes this article by first introducing the topic , then explaning what the topic really is .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity .
^p 3 .
Pythons are constantly seen around the Everglades but that is not their homeland .
Then he begins explaining how it is a bad thing that it is there .
The author organizes this article in to sections .
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results .
( a ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most .
He says , 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
Crash Course .
How much vinegar should be pour into the containers .
She cares so much for the other people in her life that she is willing to suffer .
Not specifying this could lead to variations of data , and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment .
^p 2 .
A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm .
Rose is a nice , caring girl .
The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul .
They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant .
Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him .
Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel , and feel like he was worth something .
The author organizes this article into four main sections .
Plastic type B , which stretched the longest , could have had more weight on it than the others .
^p B .
The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections .
The white ja r was and average of 42 ( DEG ) after ten minutes .
Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports .
Rose can be described by the the word caring .
Pandas and koalas are both specialists because they can survive in very specific habitats .
^p b ) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used .
The third step , the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis .
In trial one and as well as trial two .
white : : that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time .
The author organizes the article in four basic tones .
Also , how much vinegar to pour into each container .
In paragraph 19 it says , 'Rose did n't answer .
Then , the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon .
Based on the student results , I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable .
First , their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested .
You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours .
1 .
Osmosis : Osmosis is a type passive transport across a barrier , such as a cell membrane .
Chinese pandas can eat only bamboo while Australian koalas eat only eucalyptus too .
Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer .
It 's a comet !
To know that all the plastics were the same length .
They could have specified which plastics they used , not just A , B , c & d. 2 .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation is that shes kind .
It encourages him to excel in both school and sports .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and do not require a specific type of food .
Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right .
And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples .
Plastic Type B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least .
While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm .
Then the author gives some background information about what space junk really is .
Another good thing would be to have multiple trials .
Mr. Leonard explained to him that he had flunked out .
We know this because in paragraph 4-6 , Rose is very concerned about the well-being of her younger sister .
They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic .
Mr. Leonard was fanstatic at hurdles in college and was going to go very far in that world .
And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk .
So look at the sky .
Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material .
At first Paul just sees Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor in his school .
Paragraphs six and seven tell you how dangerous space junk really is .
Finally , you 'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use .
While the lowest temperature was 42 ( DEG ) for the white lid .
He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past .
Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard 's past as a track star .
^p 2 ) How much vinegar should be in each cup ?
As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane , cells use selective permeability .
'Crash Course ' describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut .
1 ) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation .
As the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species .
Paul ca n't read and neither could Mr. Leonard .
The author divides the article up into separate sections .
he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like 'what is space junk '
^p 2 .
A solution is difficult , but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space .
The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard 's past .
They are both very good at track and neither of them can read .
The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest .
Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate .
It 's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her .
Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average .
They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount .
In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm .
This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader .
Then , background information on space exploration and what 'space junk ' really is .
The author ends the article giving his or hers opinion about what the artivle is discussing .
The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article .
One trait that is shown is how she is caring .
For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm .
When she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care .
He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment .
He knew how it felt not to read .
According to the student 's results , type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable .
Therefore , Paul understood why Mr. Leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something .
One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup .
She does n't want to hurt others around her so she keeps many of her feelings inside .
They give more facts and number that we can not ignore .
Then , he defines what he is going to talk about ; space junk .
The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses .
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows , mRNA enters a ribosome .
Transcription occurs here .
All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first .
He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally .
tRNA contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it .
It did n't change in either trial .
The four major steps are that the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein .
Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt 's feelings .
Paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him .
During the story , Paul does not know much about Mr. Leonard .
Pythons and other animals were imported into the states and have been kept as pets .
`` a .
then he talks about how satellites can colide with space junk and be destroyed .
Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot .
Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same .
She knows that she has a role in her family .
The second section is explaining what the space just is .
Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles .
Mr. Leonards says , ' I lost my scholarship and flunnked out . '
The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length .
Thats why in Brandi and Jerry 's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors .
After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code .
Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane .
If these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die .
She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt .
Then also finds out that he flunked out because he could n't read .
white : : I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they mostly eat one thing .
Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference .
He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon .
'Rose did n't answer .
Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo , and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
3 .
Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt .
Out of all the plastic , plastic A is the stretchiest .
Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA .
The author organizes the article into four different sections .
To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers .
' , he talks about the malfunctions and how satellites were first used .
Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic .
Mr. Leonard lost his scholarship and dropped out of college because he could not read .
how would also need to know if they used the same size cup .
Based on her conversation with Anna , one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness .
And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag .
Then , he explain more clearly about 'space junk ' in the 'What Is Space Junk ' .
Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2 .
Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read .
^p b .
They need to
It shows Paul that being good at a sport isnt everything .
And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark .
The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment .
When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard , his natural curiosity turns to empathy .
Also , I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples .
Paul also figured out that Mr. Leonard could n't read .
Paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school .
From the very beggining the author starts the sentence with a catchy and exciting lead .
In conclusion .
white : : the white had the lowest temp .
Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth , it is the strongest or least plastic plastic .
The plastic starting length , weights added , and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials .
One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials .
white : : The best paint color for the doghouse would be white .
The author has organized this article by asking questions or stating a subtitle for the next paragraph to answer .
The reader can see that this information has a great effect on Paul .
^p b .
I can not draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table .
The background information on Mr. Leonard is impowering for Paul in specific ways .
Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two .
white : : I would choose to paint the dog house white .
A trait that Rose haswould be hope .
^p 2 .
Paul is surprised about the background information .
He realized why Mr. Leonard was so interested in helping him better himself .
Crash Course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher .
A .
As time went on , he failed out .
This touches Paul because he can not read either .
The author organizes the article really well in my opinion .
To improe and compare data .
More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here .
His introduction catches the reader 's eye , and provokes him to want to continue reading .
tool bag ? '
) The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment .
The python , a generalist , is extremely adaptive and is not roled to one single food supply .
They both have only eats one type of food .
In conclusion , it can be said that plastic .
She is very sincere and thinks about other people 's and cares about other people 's feelings .
A ) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability .
On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm .
Once again in others words Paul was about to get Mr. Leonard some help with his reading problem .
This gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph .
Just like the pandas koalas eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
They also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections .
He does this because he is returning a favor .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard broke high school records in field and track .
Second they tell you what space junk is .
It then goes to the ribosome .
At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone .
Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles , and had trouble reading .
After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm .
Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock .
The article is organized chronoligically .
Osmosis is diffusion only it is with water .
In the section subtitled What Is Space Junk ?
I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical , container .
Rose is very persistent .
In the procedure , it does not tell you what the samples are , if you need to use
It . ''
Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment .
or my results may vary .
In the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier .
Paul is confused and somewhat angry .
Then he talks in order of stuff that goes on in outer space .
Many fragments float around that can not be detected .
The conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration .
Do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple .
She is always looking to the future .
This information impacts Paul greatly in the story .
The impact created hundreds of pieces of debris , each assuming its own orbital path . '
Passive transport is high to low concentration , and active transport is low to high concentration .
'He had to go .
She firsts askes her sister is she was okay .
They did not say what to do with the container when you finish .
Paul ca n't read just like Mr. Leonard .
Though just a lowly hall monitor , Mr. Leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star .
Paul knew that Mr. Leonard was probably embrassed because he could n't read and Paul knew how it felt .
Panda 's and koalas are similar because they do n't have a wide range of food choice .
This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter .
So its fairly compfortable for a dog .
That Rose was kind and did n't want to hurt anyone .
Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples .
There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment .
It shows that Rose a mature and understanding person , partly because she feels obligated to .
The only thing he was good at was track .
They are different because they are both not specialist .
Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds .
Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard failed out of college because he could not read .
The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids .
The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy .
He found out that he was a former track star who broke records in college as a freshman .
Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane .
Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment .
Evident ly , black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors .
They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated , and get very uncomfortable .
The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic .
The word `` invasive '' in the article is reffering to certain species that are disrupting the ecosystem .
The author uses the introduction to get the point across .
The author then gives an explanation for what he or she is writing about .
`` The group of students did n't specify what `` '' samples '' '' they were referring to .
Pandas in China & koalas in Australia are similar b/c they both depend on their environment to survive .
Finally , cells use active transport , which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy .
Now , they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision .
Yhe job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
These both are different from pythons because like the article says , pythons are a generalist .
The author organizes the article into several sections : the intro , 'What Is Space Junk ?
Rose does not answer this question , because she does n't want to hurt her aunt 's feelings .
Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator .
An example of this is the panda eating nothing but bamboo .
Mr. Leonard said ' I looked good back then , did n't I ? '
He finds that Mr. Leonard used to be on the track team when he was in college .
The tRNA brings the amino acids which the mRNA lines up to make a complete protein .
The author organizes the article in a way that is almost like a timeline .
^p ( B ) One way that the student could 've improved the validity is to add more trials .
The story states ' This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
How much of each sample is being poured into the container ?
If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties .
The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A .
Then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes .
He sees that even though Mr. Leonard ca n't read he still had a great accomplishement .
Theres only certain places pandas and kolas can live but as pythons begin to expand they live everywhere .
It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder .
Each head title for each paragraph has an intriguing sentence and then the paragraph has supportive details and facts .
And the black would n't be a good color , because darker colors absorb more energy .
Third , i would need to know what type of container i should use .
Invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area . ''
Let done specify which suitably materials were used : Marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong ' ?
Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup .
The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated .
He explains every topic in a different section .
He explains how satellites ran into eachotherr and caused hundreds of peices of debris in the air .
`` `` A specialist is China 's panda , which eats almost nothing but bamboo . '' ''
This type of movement requires energy from the cell .
The author first introduces the idea of space junk and the government 's concern with it .
Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis , diffusion , and active transport .
Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate .
More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water .
A .
The first section tells us about the space invasion and about general space junk .
Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least .
The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Rose is thoughtful and caring .
It 's a meteor ! ' .
Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23 .
A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with .
During the story , the reader gets information about Mr. Leonard 's track records .
'He had to go .
`` Both China 's panda and Australia 's Koala bear are both specialists .
-Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane .
The different headings talk about some of the topics that have to do with space junk .
She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her .
Rose is caring , when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family .
However , we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing , and can not overheat .
Three , what you are measuring the weight in .
It started off as the stretchiest , before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords .
of the room , i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used .
White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above .
I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure .
Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for ?
They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on .
The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant .
Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane .
The author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader 's attention .
^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length .
Based on the student 's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college .
Paul is very surprised to see that he was once a great track star and also struggled with reading .
Also , I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not .
I would even like
^p B .
In another he talks about what space junk is .
They would also need to include the four samples names , marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules , such a food into the cell .
Pandas and Koalas can not live without specialists . ''
He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out .
a ) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most .
The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm , that is more than any other bag in the two trials .
Firstly , in step one , I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here , ' ( para .
One might also want to know what type of container , how to write down the findings .
Also , I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list .
This inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
Mr. Leonards background information greatly influences Paul .
Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry .
Paul offters to train him and help him read .
Paul said , 'Learning center . '
^p B .
in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color .
The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic .
This occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane .
He follows this up by giving us a brief history of space junk .
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard .
Despite how weighed down she felt , she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family .
Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals .
in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm .
The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA .
They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap .
We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying .
Paul and Mr. Leonard have had very similar childhoods .
Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results .
I feel that the background information that Paul discovered about Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation .
When Mr. Leonard informed Paul of his reading disability , Paul sympathized with Mr. Leonard 's emotions of embarrassment .
Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and they are different from pythons because .
How long are we rinsing them ?
They never say .
For starters , Paul is somewhat astonished to find that , like him , Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
The titles of the section and article , 'Orbiting Junk ' , 'What IS Space Junk ?
Also , around how much of the samples do you need ?
This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection .
Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse .
I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul .
He uses two example .
He felt like they had the same flaws and problems .
After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials , they also need a control .
I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) c .
The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases .
The next is Crash Course an so on .
Thus , opinions on `` '' invasive '' '' species vary . ''
I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring .
I would need to know how long to wash with water for .
The author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario .
Should I
She did not want to hurt her aunts ' feelings by telling her the truth .
In addition , they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure .
I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers .
Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading .
The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water .
1 .
) , and how long to rinse for .
Then the complimentary tRNA , with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand .
`` The word `` '' invasive is extremely significant in the understanding of this article .
Pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they are less picky in their food choices .
Also , the size of the container would be helpful .
Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape .
In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm .
It shows Paul that he is not alone with his reading problem .
I would need to know how much vinegar to add .
Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip .
He could have also included the weights of the weights he added .
For example before 30 after 40 .
It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles , but was n't the best student .
Also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over . ''
In 2005 a python swallowed an alligator .
^p 2 .
Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
He might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together .
3 .
Mr. Leonard accomplish much , by setting national records and being one of the best runner .
They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were .
Thhe author gives us information on the topic and little history behind it .
2 .
and because more serious .
The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers .
if they used the white the dog house would be too cold .
In the article it says , `` '' A python swallowed an alligator ... '' '' .
It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him .
This part is the conclusion , and talks about all the problems space junk can cause .
Mr. Leonard asked Paul , 'where do you think you 're going . '
All she wants is a good life for her and her family .
I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched .
Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing .
'What Is Space Junk ?
You would also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in .
One example of the would be 'what is space junk ' .
The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern .
Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability .
Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers ( loose bonding ) .
The author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories .
She does everything she needs to do to make her family 's plan go smoothly .
Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched .
The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat , so it will keep the doghouse cooler .
The have differently adapting to all other habitats but their own .
Caring .
This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment .
I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment .
Then , he has 'Crash Course ' giving examples of previous times there has been crashes in space .
Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42 .
Finally , this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample .
This motivates Paul to work hard during school and on the track .
This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately .
Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar .
A .
^p B ) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs .
Also , how big would the cups have to be ?
The group needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials .
In the Second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk .
According to the articles they each have specific diets .
Next , another tRNA connects to the next codon , bringing in another amino acid .
they have a section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well .
She is hopeful saying maybe life would get better .
Under 'Crash Course ' , he talks about satellites and their possibilities of crashing or becoming a free-orbiting satellite .
I also would need to know how large each material is .
Then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life .
An example of this trait can be seen when she asks Anna if she is alright .
Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading .
It affects Paul in two ways .
In conclusion , plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it would n't .
First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent .
THe three types are diffusion , facilitated diffusion , and active transport .
1 .
Because the another are proliferating and hunting native specie .
The author organized the article by having an introduction and putting the information into different catagories .
The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first , it should include measurements .
It should say how much vinegar to use .
That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person .
I think Paul is shocked too find out that Mr. Leonard broke records .
When Anna brings up their missed father , she blames him for leaving the family .
In the light or dark ?
I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant .
This will give him more control over the experiment .
This shows that the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) degrees color on average than the black lid .
They are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals and can be dangerous .
'Rose did n't answer .
What type of vinegar it is should also be included .
In the story states that Paul took his free time to print out a paper about Mr. Leonard .
As the article said , they eat only one kind of food , and live in only one place .
The backrground information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on him .
He finds out they both has the same weaknesses .
First you need to know what type of samples your using .
1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2 .
The authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled , pertinant sections .
The the author broke the article down into sections .
This shows that she values others and puts them before her personal interests .
Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life .
The student could improve the experiment by through , if he tells us which amount of weight he used .
Next he talks about collisions in space .
Osmosis .
You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment .
Rose is kind at heart .
He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read .
The author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about .
Another process is diffusion .
Mr. Leonard past effects Paul , since Mr. Leoanrd had spent his own time helping Paul with track .
It stretched 22-23mm .
He knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud .
Niether of them could read and both good at track .
Unlike Mr. Leonard , he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read .
The author writes , 'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Mr. Leonard did n't tell Paul because he could n't read and flunked out of college .
white : : the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up .
The one trait I depicted from this passage was that Rose is grown up .
It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion .
Rose is a positive person .
A python is a generalist , it has a wide habitat range and can eat many different things . ''
Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability .
When all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework .
And finally , the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space .
They can only be found in certain places where their food supply is .
Finally , he explains the importance of space trash and finding a solution to the problem .
The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items .
a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
Another problem is that they did n't mention how much vinegar should be used .
The catagories the author used were 'What is Space Junk ?
He connects with him , and feels sorry for him .
^p B ) The student could have performed another trial .
The author organizes the article by using subtopics within the topic of the article .
He asked questions about it and seemed very interested .
The west flexible type of plastic was type B .
He first gives some history on waht space junk is in the section 'What is Space Junk ? '
Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative 's feelings .
^p B ) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh .
Also , this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched , not how far they stretch .
Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity .
Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container .
If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment .
He went to college on a scholoarship and broke many school records .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader just as Paul is .
One trait that Rose displays in her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is selfless .
white : : This color will cool down the dog house .
In the story , Mr. Leonard helps Paul become a good athlete after learning that he ca n't read .
In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic .
First the author grabs the readers attention by talking about a tool bag in the sky .
He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also .
If it was cold , it would n't keep it as warm , but not super cold either .
Most generalist species are invasive because they look for different places to live .
We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment .
Paul struggled reading , and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track .
Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested .
black : : The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse .
^p b .
They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container .
Their hypothesis was correct .
Then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled 'What is Space Junk . '
It helps the validity of the experiment .
B ) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial .
The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard .
Another way that it could 've been improved was to do more trials .
Her not telling the truth to her Aunt , shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings .
To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant .
Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration .
Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles .
Paul seem intrested in what had happened .
They rely on one exclusive food source .
Thus , creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds .
They both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species .
So , i n conclusion , I 've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice .
This process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy .
Other than this , the experiment was written decently .
Fir example , the Burmese python is threatening fire endangered species in the filmla keys .
The autor begins by getting the readers attention .
Paul finds out that Mr , Leonard has a reading disability .
It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in .
The background information on Mr. Leonard helps him relate to Paul .
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard was familiar .
In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed .
The author organizes the article by starting off with the question ' 'What Is Space Junk ? '
No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read .
Paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46 .
Therefore we could see how much it 's stretched .
And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity 's that will never come again .
Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on .
They are similar because they are both animals .
You feel that she really cares for her family and does n't want to upset anyone .
^p b .
The coach gives Paul a website to go to .
I would also need the amount trials done .
How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I do n't know what the samples are .
Different weights can cause different results .
To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing .
Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better .
This could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment .
Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
Then comes the Conclusion that gives the author 's opinion on the topic of the 'space junk ' crisis .
He or she included a variety of information in each of these sections .
The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock .
white : : It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse .
Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles , and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading .
Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched .
She seems hopeful , even though she has it rough .
In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius .
2 .
When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be , Paul was filled with unbelief .
That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
It reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading .
^p 4 .
' , to explain what the introduction was about .
He starts off with a great introduction that has the ability to catch the reader 's attention .
They are both different from a python because a python is a generalist while pandas and koalas are specialists .
When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star , Paul was shocked it seemed .
The next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk .
She speaks about Paul and how he will eventually come back to help them .
Paul , who also could n't read , felt close to Mr. Leonard .
The author writes about Earth 's satellites , how they get there , and what they do .
tRNA creates codons from anticodons3 .
a . )
So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white .
Paul suddenly realizes why this janitor was helping him out so much .
But he is honored to be coached by him .
Such as colliding satellites .
In line 40 , Paul asks 'Well , what happened after that . '
By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate .
A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant .
Samples of what ?
The dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C , w hich might be too hot .
light gray : : Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color .
Also , they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion .
Also a python is carnivorous and it 's died ranges .
The author continues with background information .
Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler .
The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4 .
Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna .
That shows that she was working hard enough to make her tired .
It had the most streching for both the first and second trial , 22mm and 23 mm .
In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading .
These subtitles give the readers something to think about before the read that specific section of the article .
becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45 ( DEG ) .and that in perfect tempature
First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container .
Also , in the article the author says pythons were often kept as house pets .
They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant .
The author uses subtitles to organize the article .
He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self .
They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting .
the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar .
^p -In step 4 , how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given .
a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2 .
The article is organized by the author into sections .
Then , by titleing the section 'What Is Space Junk ?
Despite these feelings , Rose tries to remain positive for Anna 's sake , and holds her tongue .
Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red .
Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college .
^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more . ''
Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard .
That made Paul want to study harder than before .
Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and did n't change/ .
He ended up losing his scholarship , and flunking out of college .
That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler .
I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use , it does n't state it clearly .
Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened .
The Author organizes the article into three sections .
The necessary samples : marble , limestone , wood , and plastic , are not listed in the procedure .
She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States .
^p 3 ) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass .
Because he could n't read .
Ex : kitchen wrap , grocery bag , cooking wrap etc .
^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it .
You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample .
Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard ca n't read just like himself .
You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup .
Reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports .
to define and descibe the problem at hand .
This could help determine which plastic 's better .
They live where they do because that is where they can survive .
' C'mon , Mr.Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm .
You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed . ''
Paul said , 'Well , what happened after that ? '
Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers .
In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are .
The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar was increased or decreased .
Panda 's eat almost nothing but bamboo , while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively .
'No school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him .
Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1 .
The author starts by explaining what the problem is in the section 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics .
to get the reader involved and to provide factual information .
For this experiment , I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup .
The first section is called Orbiting Junk .
The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison .
The author starts off the article by catching the readers interest and attention .
Plastic type B was the most stretchable .
They are much different than python reason being is that pythons will eat anything that is meat .
They would also need to know what containers they used .
But just like Paul Mr. Leonard can not read .
It also informs readers of how scientists are trying to overcome the issue of space junk .
^p b ) First , the student should have used the same length of each plastic .
This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment .
That makes it a possible invasive species .
white : : the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot .
Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' can be looked at in two ways in the article .
How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic .
Type B stretched the most at 23 mm .
In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know which 4 samples to use .
'Its only been four months . '
One way they could have improved was to do another trial .
The darker the color of the lid got , the warmer the inside of the jar was .
Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists .
As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard , he was a hall monitor .
2 : The student uses samples with varying length , therefore making his results invalid .
The first one , entitled 'What is Space Junk ? '
They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours .
Then the article goes on to say that space junk is becoming a problem .
A ) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid .
First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are .
The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him .
One trait that describes Rose , based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined .
The panda and koala are generalists .
The author organizes the article by first letting the readers know what space junk was .
Light gray was in the mid dle of the data .
And that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had .
the Australia koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
After that he tells how this 'space junk ' is formed .
He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer .
This was something that Paul could relate to .
The second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother .
Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard .
For example , the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard .
To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
Another process is called facilitated diffusion .
Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long .
And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched .
Another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk .
They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable .
The next two sections are about how Space Junk is made and what it can cause .
Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane .
It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before .
dark gray : : I would use dark gray .
The author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala bear both only eat plants .
'What is Space Junk ? '
-
^p b ) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type .
Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him .
Then there is another titled ' 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
He had lost his scholarship though , because he could n't read .
^p b ) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial .
He is helping Paul become the athlete that Mr. Leonard used to be .
but he was a really good athlete .
Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
This allows the reader to take in as mcuh information as possible .
Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain .
In Little Bits , But a Big Deal , the author elaborates on why we should be concerned .
They are different form pythons because pythons are generalist .
( The temperature should be consistant )
Finally he explains what organizations like NASA and ESA are doing to solve the problem .
Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added .
Also they should do another trial and then average out the results .
The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B .
Then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing and how it IS a huge problem .
Pandas and koalas are both similar because they are specialists or only eat a very limited variety in foods .
He first starts out with an introduction .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes .
Furst , the author opens with an introduction to grab the readers attention .
It talks about space debree , and how to solve the problem .
ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane .
The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog .
This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell .
Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills .
Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track .
If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties .
And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size .
Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister .
Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school .
The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be .
Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A .
^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers .
Where should the samples dry , warm , cold , in the sun ?
According to the students data the conclusion that plastic .
The section titled 'Crash Course ' posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk .
When he asks Mr. Leonard about it he finds that Mr. Leonard ca n't read either .
The author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections , 'What is Space Junk ?
The tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous .
Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic .
They area both different from pythons , generalist species , who can eat a lot of different animals .
`` Fix this experiment , the procedure needs additional information .
A ) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable .
She is caring for her sister .
The author organizes the article by having an introduction that grabs the readers attention .
For example , I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample .
In saying sections , I am referring to the titles through out the article .
I would also need to know what sample goes in each container .
Throw away containers .
This experiment will need more trials to see if the results are convincing .
The Chinese panda and Australian koalas are similar species .
It 's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters .
I think that this is a very organized article .
Soon ending is essay with a persitant conclusion about how the space agencies can find a more efficent way .
white : : The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest .
However , due to natural disaster , they have managed to escape and moved into the wild .
'It 's time to start your training . '
Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read .
Rose is help ful because she help around the house and help Paul finish college .
Type B has the most stretchability .
at 42 degrees celsius
Once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time .
Wha sample materials are they useing .
She knows she has a job to look out for her family .
The author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion .
The author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line .
In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure .
In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration .
Well , after reading the second paragraph , we know what that is .
The author starts off light-hearted and keeps getting more serious .
He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for .
Each section provides important statistics on the topic .
She does not like hurting other people .
He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him .
Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read .
After leaving the Nucleus , the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3 .
Rose can be descirbed as hopeful .
Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better .
An example of good orginaziton is that he dos n't get side tract .
It also gives light to possible solutions .
Specify what the samples are in step 1 .
the paint had the lowest temp .
They both are mammals which make them different from a python .
As she attempts to get out , water fills her mouth and she sinks further down .
^p b .
We need to know this as well .
The author begins the article with a common phrase 'It 's a bird !
The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water , without using energy .
You broke records . '
Mr. Leonard tells Paul he flunked out of college .
Material just flow through the cells pores .
' , is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris .
The second section , 'What Is Space Junk ?
During her conversation with Aunt Kolab , Rose does n't tell her how she feels .
They be at a loss of food and climate change .
I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard ' .
With the first main point , he asks , 'What is Space Junk ? '
`` To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample .
Thirdly , the author transitions into talking about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other .
In paragraph one , the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things .
It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount .
To replicate the experiment , you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh .
The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample .
passive transport where the need niether energy or a key
The need to have all the materials and put it in order .
Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is .
Rose did n't answer .
Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container .
Paul is shocked by the news , he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard .
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard is encouraging to Paul .
In the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause .
So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard .
Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion , osmosis , and endocytosis .
1 .
You ca n't do an experiment if you do n't know what you 're testing on .
Start off paragraph six with a little story about free orbiting space junk .
First , the author gives an introduction , informing the readers what the article will be about .
They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers , which could also impact result .
Then , the author tells how the space junk actually gets where it is .
They could of also tell us a specific weight .
^P b .
Material type A stretched the least , and material type B stretched the most .
She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is .
The third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space .
But failed out for not being able to read .
Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are invasive species .
Considering the plastic was already stretched .
Mr. Leonard went through the same troubles as Paul is now .
He worked with Mr. Leonard and never gave up on him just like he was not given up on .
He was surprised at at how Mr. Leonard had never shared his elite college hurdling experience .
Cells use osmosis to either gain or get rid of water by passing it across the cell membrane .
^p 4 .
Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm .
The author then talks about satellites and how they can become dead and just float freely in space .
So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white .
The third section describes the dangerous collisions that take place in space between the different satellites and such .
One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups .
Leonared , ' I said , walking back toward school .
He shows how things can fall in to the orbit and show how it can effact the earth .
Last , you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold .
Also , I would need to know what samples I am using .
Paul then later finds that Mr. Leonard faced the same trouble in high school .
He started with What Is Space junk , whick explains what he 's talking about .
Based on Rose 's conversations , it is very obvious that she is a caring person .
a .
First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome .
Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length .
One trait that describe Rose is that she is a hard worker .
In conclusion , scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched .
In the introduction , the author opens with a surprising statement of a toolbag in space .
Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers .
The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores .
Pandas and koalas are specialists and pythons are generalists .
First , we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers , enough to cover them ?
Next he gets right into explaining exactly what the article is about .
Change as goes on now , favors the generalist . ''
They then go on to tell of the dangers of space junk floating around in space .
During protein synethesis , the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription .
Also , good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials .
The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most .
Then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal .
An example from the article is ; ( last paragraph ) Rose kept nodding .
The introduction , which was to get the reader interested .
As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature .
They are both specialists , AKA animals with a selective/exclusive diet .
Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell .
Rose goes to school and has a part-time job .
What is the sample material .
This will help because during the summer when it is hot , it will keep the doghouse cooler .
You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
Cell mebranes are semi-permeable .
The python does n't eat anything that is needed .
I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment ... ' ( 45 ) .
I would also need to how much vinegars to put in the containers .
gives you a better idea for what it space junk is .
In order to replicate this experiment , the group would need some additional information in their procedure .
Both pandas and koalas are extreme specialists .
Plastic type A has the worst stretchability .
a ) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A , C & D when weights are added to it .
1 .
Then , the author begins telling about space junk and how the government have great concern about space junk .
By doing this they are letting you know specific information about space junk .
She does n't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet .
Based on the student 's data , plastic type B stretched the most .
An example would be , Paul can not read and neither can Mr. Leonard .
To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup .
^p - What to label each of the separate containers .
Then he 'll get a good job , Anna , and he 'll pay for our college . ' .
The author organizes the article by topic .
The author also states that if space agencies help then maybe space pollution will decrease .
`` China 's panda and Australia 's koala are similar because they eat the same thing constintly .
Third , we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish .
You would need to know what samples you would need to use .
Paul also understood how Mr. Leonard felt ; embarrassment , and the longing to be like other kids .
The author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk .
'What Is Space Junk ?
In Summer , you would n't wan t the dog house to be over-heated .
Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2 .
There is no control in the starting length of the plastics .
Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch .
Next , he or she defines Space Junk .
A .
That shows it has the most durability for stretching .
The author organizes this article using passages for different information .
Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm .
a ) Based on the student data , plastic B is the most stretchable .
If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy .
I would need to know what to label the containers .
One way this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents .
He feels like he knew exactly where Mr. Leonard was coming from .
I should have the exact type of material .
A second way he could 've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used .
We can use plastic or metal or another .
'What is Space Junk ' gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is .
Additional information that would be needed .
^p Did a third trial .
Based on the students data , plastic type D has the most sretchability .
The author also uses varies fact throughout the article .
So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out .
Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard when he learns about Mr. Leonard 's background information .
black : : Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
The author organizes this article in to different columns stating with an intuduction .
On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm .
The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure .
They specify to one type of substance that is crucial to their survival that without they could possibility die .
In this section , the author gives background information about where space junk comes from .
You broke records . '
Pandas can only eat bamboo and koala bears mostly eat eucalyptus leaves .
Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell .
Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics .
Crash Course explains how an American and Russian satellite crashed , resulting in small pieces of debris .
Rose is caring .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the fact that they are both specialists .
I would need to know how much vinegar they used .
a ) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials .
He aslso includes that the problem is getting worse but agencies hope to work together to reduce space pollution .
This shows how grateful Paul is .
Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm .
So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house .
12 degree difference !
3 .
The author has separated these things into three sections .
The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide .
In space , even tiny particles will cause some major damage .
They student variable unchecked .
In order to replicate ta experiment , a person would need to know a few more things .
b ) The student could have had another trial to test validity .
We do n't know the original lengths of plastic .
^p B .
We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment .
Each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space .
The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope .
She tries to get her sister to think positive about the situations in their family .
The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to .
Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had , at one time , run track .
One of the subheadings is : What Is Space Junk ? .
He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done .
Look up at the sky !
The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample .
She is hoping and trusting that Paul will do well in college .
Suddently I realized what I could do for him . '
They are n't spreading around the world and are different from pythons because pythons are dangerous and spreading .
Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star .
She tells Anna , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching .
crashed into each other 491 mi .
No matter how small the space junk is , it is dangerous .
You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add .
In case there was no data table present .
This allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped .
Mr.Leonard backround show his difficalty in reading just like Paul .
By contrast , the python is a generalist .
She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college .
Rose seems very caring and always think about others .
This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt .
They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up .
The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample .
The snakes , he says , are are impelling 5 endangered species in the Florida Keys '' '' .
It suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic .
A ) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length .
Paul 's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting Mr. Leonard about the startling information he discovered online .
A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup .
How big the containers are ^p 5 .
The hall monitor , Mr. Leonard , decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling .
Should I use a lot of vinegar , or a little ?
You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it .
It 's a meteor ! .
They should have specified the mass of the weights used .
Paul said , 'But you went to college . '
To replicate the groups procedure , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
Also , for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials .
In the side heading Crash Course , the story tells us of crashes in history and gives specific examples .
Pouring different amonts could change the mass .
That is any for f them live here .
A ) The stretchiest of the four materials was B , with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm 's .
Each section has a header indentifying it .
'It 's time to start your training . '
For long should the sample be rinsed ? ''
Invasive is a negative connotation because invasive species are usually threats to biodiversity .
Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration .
but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read .
But , it is still dangerous in space .
( ex 5 minutes )
They are both vegetarian .
The section labeled 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
The article starts off with the introduction , then to the section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
He was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student .
The ending creates a good give-take relationship .
However , these students need to improve their experimental design .
Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume .
The author organizes the article by suptitles going from the most improtnant to the least .
Which this has already happened in 2009 .
Following the Introduction is the Body of the article that explains the main idea further .
Look up at the sky !
When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader , he realizes they are alike .
Mr. Leonard asked , 'Why . '
All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are very similar to each other in many ways .
a ) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B , and the least stretchable is plastic A .
Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ?
In both trials , this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest .
It would also put what effect of materials its going to use .
^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment .
For example , add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes .
They could 've said the weight of the weights are used .
a ) Plastic B has the most stretchability .
Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard .
She works alot to help pay their way in this country .
At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified .
He did n't know how to read .
This is because both have stuggled with reading .
Even though this is just vinegar , their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab .
A python in the everglades on 2005 was caught eating a alligator .
Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down .
The author puts all the main points as his title .
Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges .
In the Everglades in a very rare case a python attempted to eat a alligator and exploded .
Was because he did n't know how to read .
Both trials it had the highest length .
In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black .
She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them .
She went from school , straight to her work , and then right back home to help her aunt .
Before he did n't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The author organizes the artical well .
' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , it 's time to start your training . '
Some additional information you will need are the material .
^p b .
After that , they tell why space junk is harmful and dangerous .
He then writes of how the 'junk ' gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue .
The author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way .
The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest .
Also , you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water .
Then he puts the information into different catagories .
They should have specified the amount of weight .
Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard had been a track star .
The author starts off with an attention grabber , allowing the audience to get hooked and read more .
Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles .
Goggle inclusion would also be rise .
So they should say the names of it .
Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard because he had trouble reading as well .
They both only eat one thing , pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus .
'Crash Course ' is all about collisions with satellites and other space junk that is orbiting the Earth .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists .
you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water .
mainly scotching hot .
The author organizes the article by starting off with a very clear introduction that captures the reader 's attention .
Based on her conversation with Anna , Rose comes across as understanding .
Paul understands exactly how Mr. Leonard feels , 'embarrassed . '
How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains .
The author separates his different information into groups , by content .
One trait of Rose 's is reassurance .
This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials .
The subtitle 'Crash Course ' provides a specific example of space debris being created .
Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read .
Not only does she care about school and doing her best , she cares about her family .
Plastic D stretched 20 mm 's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4 .
The author explains how invasive species `` '' are major threat to biodiversity '' '' .
The black lid absorbed 11 ( DEG ) more heat than the white lid .
The author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about .
tRNA then attaches to the mRNA , matching its bases to those of the mRNA .
Also , she should tell what plastics were used .
) How much vinegar should go into each container ?
You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container , so the results are accurate .
Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2 .
The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D , which stretched to 20mm both times .
First the author catches your attention and states the problem .
Should it be the same or different .
As he goes on he talks about what happens with a collision .
The next day after finding the information about Mr. Leonard .
Paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime .
The author of this article starts with getting you intrested in what he has to say .
They could 've put the same amount or different amount .
Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are .
And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar .
The author organizes this article by giving us some information about space junk .
I think that Rose is loving .
They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added .
Robray MacInnes distinguishes between the the two by saying that generalists favor change and specialists favor stability .
They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need .
As long as they are around humans they will survive better .
Thoughtful .
The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be .
The subtitle 'What is Space Junk ' describes the history of space travel and how space junk is created .
The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport .
Mr. Leonard wamted the narrator to succeed because of what happened to himself .
If she otld the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Also the trials have different results of type A , from trial 1 plastic type A stretched .
But Mr. Leonard was more then just a hall monitor .
Samples of what ?
1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2 .
You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system .
But in their defining characteristics , they are very similar .
To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get .
First , the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers .
Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each .
He begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention .
This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers .
Also list the type of meteral they roused .
It stretched 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one .
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because , they both mostly eat leaves .
So he decided he could help Mr.Leonard out by training him .
First , he starts with the introduction .
In the story it says , 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
Another would be how much of the samples ?
The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers .
The final paragraph reads , ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
Some additional information you would need a control .
Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4 .
This story occurred in Februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris .
While Ana believes family should come before work and money .
Secondly , there should be a precise amount of weights being added .
The author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come .
a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm .
You broke records . '
Pythons can eat anything , as long as they 're living in an environment that is suitable for them .
The author then gives a breif history on 'space junk ' .
Also , it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also .
Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other .
From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly .
Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials .
Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic .
During Rose 's conversation with her aunt , the passage says , 'Rose did n't answer .
After that , nobody wanted a runner that could not read .
Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well .
Pythons in Asia inhabit climates like that of the u.s says the article . ''
Naturally , he progressed how space junk developed into a problem for space explorers in 'Crash Course ' .
How the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory .
They should say what 4 samples are being tested , not just `` mass 4 samples '' .
The author explains the problem in the introduction and first paragraph .
The author provides facts and opinions in each subtopic to enlighten the reader about space .
^p ( 2 ) How much vinegar to add to each sample .
However , their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true .
^p ( 3 ) Add another 3 trials with different weight .
'Rose kept nodding .
that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow .
The author opens the article with an intense introduction , but then settles down into a serious tone .
`` The word invasive sums up the main idea of this article .
It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used .
^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics . ''
For example , plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1 & 2 .
Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p ( 2 ) Create a T3 and try it once more .
Type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you
A python will eat anything from a key largo wood rat to a common house pet .
At the end the author summarizes the article with a conclusion .
The organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader .
Paul understands why Mr. Leonard put so much effort into him .
then there 's 'what Is Space Junk ?
In order to increase the validity of the experiment .
She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away .
This shows that unlike pandas and koalas , pythons can adapt to other environments .
Which will create a nice segway to talk about 'Little Bits , But a big Deal '
They share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them .
The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types .
Once he finds out why , he feels a stronger connection between the two .
In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples .
Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful .
What Is Space Junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place .
^p b .
Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
The author organizes this article in sections .
Human and equipment errors as always possible .
How much vinegar would you pour in each cup .
The article finishes with a conclusion that outlines space pollution and the issues that can arise because of it .
At the end paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment .
Mr. Leonard does n't know how to read and is helping Paul with hurdles .
a .
The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment .
As a conclusion to the data shown on the table , plastic B had the most stretchability .
Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in .
Pandas and koala bears are similar because they are both bears .
The darker the color of something , the more heat the object absorbs .
The author organizes this article in a way that grabs your attention at the beginning .
She 's not only worried about herself , but Paul also .
^P 1 .
In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two .
The author then goes into detail about launching the first satellite .
I would also need to know what type of container .
To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples .
HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more .
white : : Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42 ( DEG ) C
The four different samples , mass of them , and where they were put is stated .
The author starts the article with an attention getter .
During the story , the readers gets backround information about Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes the article from the basics of space .
She is always willing to see what is best for the other person in the relationship .
I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was .
Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second .
Finally , I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it .
An amino acid chain forms
Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing .
In T1 it Stretched 22 mm , and in T2 it stretched 23mm .
And what are the four different samples ?
They are similar because they both only eat a very small range of foods , they are specialists .
The author organizes the articles by producing several different titles and layering supporting evidence with facts .
The author organizes the article by headlines .
The author starts off with background information starting off with facts about the first artificial satellite .
Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading .
No college wanted someone who could n't read .
You feel okay ? '
The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials .
This section informs the reader on how the debris gets into space and what exactly space junk is .
They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh .
Also , what is the size of the containers ?
^p B ) The students could have done more trials .
The author organizes the article with an introduction , and three body paragraphs .
She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her .
She is considerate .
When Anna has a bad dream , Rose says , `` What 's wrong ?
^p 2 .
He is also curious on why he didnt finish college .
On the other hand a python can eat many different things and has many more options .
The author started off by telling us what space junk is , then went into the different catergories .
Active transport , unike passive , reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane .
Panda and koala bears differ from pythons based on what they eat . ''
One Trait that shows how Rose is as a person is that she is very mature .
That would also be helpful .
Rose is very respectfull of her elders .
The effect that has on Paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards Mr. Leonard .
The author starts by explaining to us about the concern of space junk .
This procedure also should specify what materials to use , line what brand of cups or size .
Rose is very caring .
^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results .
The main difference between specialists and generalists is that one can adapt and one can not . ''
Each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs .
If this happens , the competition may leave the native species endangered or even intimet .
Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples .
Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure .
Then 'Crash Course ' , tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother .
Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used .
It did n't say how much which is important .
According to the results from the experiment , the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53 .
Then the author explains what exactly is space junk and how it is formed .
Could have had 3 trials .
Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang .
Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals .
Plastic A + B stayed stretched from the T1 and then streched more in T2 .
The measures of every plastic should be the same to start .
Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me .
This also makes him want to help with his reading problems .
^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it 's left hanging .
It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container .
If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool , they should use white paint .
The pythons though are addapting all over the U.S to different environment unlike the animals above .
white : : I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials .
All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment .
The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them .
This means that they only eat specific items , such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
It would help to know how large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount .
The pythons is a generalist .
These animals are usually thought of as harmful to the environment it lives in .
What size and configuration should the containers be ?
So , Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help .
Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials ?
Both animals eat plants .
`` a . )
This debris is very troublesome because spacecrafts get damaged by this debris and it becomes very dangerous .
Koala 's do much of the same thing .
Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length .
Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport .
Little Bits , but a Big Deal explains that objects in free-orbit is an important matter .
A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength .
If these three were added to the procedure , then you could replicate the experiment .
Lastly , I must know where the containers were placed , in the sun , shade , etc .
After asking her if she was ok she went and poured her a glass of orange juice .
So the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals .
They could have also added more trials to get a better result .
The plastics should be a set length .
How much vinegar to put in each container ^p 2 .
Invasive species , like the python in the everglades are beginning to threat native species .
Paul can sympathize with Mr. Leonard .
Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level .
This always verifies the validity of an experiment .
The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard .
'This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free .
Rose is considerate of other people 's feelings .
The author organizes the article by starting with a introduction to grab the reader 's attention .
Paul read Mr. Grabowski website and finally figured out that he could n't read either .
Paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased .
The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems .
The author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk .
After that they tell you about the crash course .
In the last sentence , Paul says , `` C'mon , Mr. Lenoard .
defines the subject to the reader so that they fully understand the article .
The one trait I think that describes rose is , that she is caring .
They can not read very well .
Also , the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities .
Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard use to be a really good runner , but was bad at reading .
This could help make sure there was no faulty data , such as an outlier .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known .
Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials .
The python eats many other things .
You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry .
First , we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment .
In able to complete this experiment .
