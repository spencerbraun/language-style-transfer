in the article it says pandas and koalas both eat plants
they also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh
its diet changes according to its surrounding food sources
pandas from china and koalas from australia are both specialists
right now there is no constant in the experiment
it includes headings with short paragraghes under them
the plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it
the student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched
that makes black degrees hotter then white
which this has already happened in
i would need to know what size or shape of container to use
paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out mr leonard struggles with reading
next he uses crash course to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space
one trait that can describe rose from her conversations with anna and aunt kolab is caring
during the story gifts paul learns some interesting and shocking information about mr leonard
the procedure given doesnt have enough information so that someone could replicate it
also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference
telling him cmon mr leonard as they walked back towards the school
so paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center
mr leonard explained to him that he had flunked out
white the color white would affect the dog house in many good ways
they could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them
white might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day
some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment
plastic type b was the plastic with the greatest stretchability
paul finds out that mr leonard also struggled with literature and reading
you will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after
the author explains how invasive species are major threat to biodiversity
the volume could each have to be equal to get the best results
we have our part to do to help paul finsh college
a based on the data shown the polymer plastics will streach but not much
the procedure does not state what the samples are
chinas panda and australias koala bear both only eat plants
crash course and little bits but a big deal
the procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass
you need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
they should of said how much the clamp weighed
they start off with explaining what the rest of the article was going to be talking about
youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples
type b plastic stretched mm the first trial and mm the second trial
a the more weight used the more the plastic stretched
this helps paul relate to mr leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners
a specialist can only live in one place where as a generalist can live almost anywhere
also other info would be what size containers do you need for this experiment
one piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure
in trials one and it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters
they differ from pythons because pythons eat a variety of things not just one thing
paul follows directions and finds out about mr leonards past
if they wa nted the temperature to be warm they would paint the doghouse black
pandas from china and koala from australia both eat almost nothing but one particular thing
paul realizes that he and mr leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought
for example in subsection what is space junk the author explains exactly what is space junk
she would rather suffer herself than make anyone else hurt
the temperature used for explanation w as the average
the author provides facts and opinions in each subtopic to enlighten the reader about space
a plastic type b is made of the stretchiest material
it even inspires paul to start to teach mr leonard how to read
validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang
lastly does it matter the material of the container glass metal
it should have a constant mass for each of the samples
rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt
the second section is about two satellites colliding wih one another causing microdebris
also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results
it gives me brief information about the article
both animals live almost exclusively on a single food source bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively
and the last paragraph little bits but a big deal explains why space debris is so important
i think that plastic type b is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials
also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go
and they should keep the weights on for longer this will give more extensive and accurate data
one thing the student couldve improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size
facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane
without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment
they then go into a brief descrption of space junk
she is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family
furst the author opens with an introduction to grab the readers attention
crash course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves
one trait that would describe rose would be helpful
you will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment
the author organized the article with an inroduction and a body
first the author starts out with what the article is going to be about
pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists
mr leonard explains that he couldnt read and that he flunked out of college
in crash course the author says how the debris is created
the word invasive helps to provide debate on this article
it will show him to never give up and always try your best in life
paul now can see why mr leonard is helping him and is thankful
invasive is the right word to describe these actions
the python can live almost anywhere and eat a variety of things
as one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane cells use selective permeability
many reptiles such as snakes and lizards have invaded america
her not telling the truth to her aunt shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings
paul knows what its like to not be able to read
rose did not reply to her aunts question if she was feeling weighed down for this reason
both are mammals unlike the python which how many different foodprey and is a reptile
paul is very thankful towards mr leonard for helping him get faster
however the light gray lid had an average of deg in the tr ials
a based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most
it is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in
no nother school wanted a runner who couldnt read
these students procedure was not a reliable one
the procedure is missing some critical info
we also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space
meanwhile pythons have a variety of things to eat from
rrna combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain
in step the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples
he starts with the introduction by introducing space junk
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia
osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell
in fact he pulled out the document about mr leonards accomplishment and showed it to him
the introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here
paul does not know what mr leonard did before he worked at the school
in this section the author gives background information about where space junk comes from
atp allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient
plastic type a is the least stretchable it only stretched and mm the least out of all
the group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container
the author organizes the article by having a introduction as being a attention getter
the subtitle what is space junk describes the history of space travel and how space junk is created
the white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer
knowing this paul was releaved and was glad to help mr leonard with his reading
rose is family oriented she cares about her family
at the ribosomes trna attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mrna
to finish the process a trna leaves and the ribosome moves down the mrna to the next codon
after reading this experiment there is a lot id need to know
based on her conversation with anna one can deduce that a defining characteristic of rose is her selflessness
chinas panda eats nothing but bamboo australias koala bear that eats eucalyptus
another thing the student can do is add one more trial
lastly plastic a stretched the least with an average of mm
pandas in china and koalas in australia are both specialists while phythons are generalists
i would need to know where to put all of the different containers
next we move on to what is space junk which explains the history of space exploration
white white would be the best color to paint the do g house
this shows that plastic b is the most stretchable
white ended up about degc while black was about degc
one process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis
also it makes paul have empathy for mr leonard
hopefully they can both learn to read and help eachother along the way
python are a generalist species so they can adapt to places that are not ther homeland
the generalist that are spread accidentally have seen to be invasive to that environment
such as why out of all people he choose paul to work with
they should have specified the amount of weight
start off paragraph six with a little story about free orbiting space junk
you know by looking in the data table when they dont list items in the procedure
none of the other plastic types stretched as much plastic d one the closest at mm
lastly the third section tells the aftermath
you would also need to have the samples all the same size
rose is very considerate to the feelings of others
paul could easily relate to mr leonard
three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is
the author organized the article by trying to catch the readers attention first
one would need to know maly things in order to replicate the groups procedure
my conclusion is plastic type b is the most stretchy
towards the end of the story paul learns more about mr leonard and his past
the story states this man had given his time to help me excel at something
also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar
i would also include the samples of what i am testing in the experiment
white if you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun
then the author talks about how dangerous it is when objects in space collide
the author organizes it in a way to make it easily understandable to the reader
section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration
the process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information
i can conclude that plastic type b was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type
the student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length
in the way that they both just eat mainly one type of plant
panadas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they mainly only eat one type of food
they first describe what space junk is in what is space junk
as for white is would get the least amount of heat
the mrna leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein
white painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors
the author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups
dark gray the dark grey would keep the doghouse warm b ut not too hot
some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit
paul asked why didnt you tell me about this
and if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunitys that will never come again
it should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble
light gray the best paint color for the dog house would be light grey
white the color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature
it also gives him the motivation to tutor mr leonard at the end of the story
the experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one
in the story rose asks anna you feel okay
after reading the group procedure the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples
the additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples
they are different from pythons bc pythons are generalists who can live in many different habitats successfuly
diffusion is also one during diffusion a substance moves from high to low concertration
based on the students data its safe to say that plastic sample a was the strongest
the author organizes the article by using subtopics within the topic of the article
these animals differ from pythons because they are considered specialists as pythons are generalists
paul does this by saying that mr lenard has some training to do
the effect it has on paul is the support he gets from someone just like him
paul is motivated because mr leonard had the same problems paul is sturggling with
how much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not
using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar
i can also conclude plastic a has the lowest stretchability at to mm
the author organizes the article into three sections following the introduction
the author organizes the article into three different sections
she doesnt want to tell her aunt because she might tell her mother or hurt her aunt
this means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds
first of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are
three ways to do this are active passive and diffusion
the should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment
a trait that rose shows in her conversation with aunt koleb is caring
the student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to
this paragraph defines space junk and explains how it is formed
additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights
plastic d stretched mms both times making it the nd most stretchable out of the
all dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways
obviously when mr leonard looked at paul he saw himself as a child
all of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane
after that he breifly explains the space age in what is space junk
another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to be added to each
a based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most
the section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris
this shows the reader that tiny space fragments are a big deal and could really hurt somebody
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are specialists and only eat one food
the pandas in china are similar to the koalas in australia because they are both specialists
i say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler
and also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag
it uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through
chinese pandas and australian koala bears are similar because theyre both specialists
the next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships
he might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally
anticodons that are in the trna are paired with the codons in the mrna
it would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be
the author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario
one trait that i found that could describe rose is she is a kind person
a plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic
one trait that can describe rose based on her converstation with aunt kolab is that she is caring
chinas panda is similar to australias koala because they both only live on one main food
based on the students data the conclusion i draw was that plastic b had the greatest stretchability
to replicate the groups experiment more information is neccesary
their is active transport passive transport and then their is gradient transport
she can not attend because she is willing to work to keep her job
white the best color for the dog house is white
additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container
now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read
first you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup
the procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers
my hypothesis of i believe that plastic type b will stretch the longest was correct
a list of materials and safety requirements
pandas and koalas are similar because they mostly eat one thing
by this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone
according to the students data the conclusion that plastic
then they explain to the reader what space junk is and that it is dangerous
the third is to record the information obtained
also the students should have used plastics of all the same length
the first section just explains that there are things in space called space junk
the students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items
mr leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college
the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
to define and descibe the problem at hand
three types of movement that cells use to move substances acrossed the membrane are one is osomis
to include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table
they are different from pythons because neither of them eat meat and also pythons are generalist species
then mr leonard told paul about his school life and that he couldnt read either
paul wants to be like mr leonard but instead he wants to survive college
this trait is shown when she says we have to do our part to help paul finish college
the author organizes the article into different aspects of space junk
black black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy
rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister annas life
the author procedes with one idea at a time describing was space debris is
invasive is a very significant word in this article
tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it
they could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane
white i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white
where as pythons have been known to swallow an alligator
and the average tempreature for the color white was degrees
they didnt mention how much vinegar to put in the containers
paul is very surprised to see that he was once a great track star and also struggled with reading
plastic b stretched the most out of all of the plastics
the amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated
but not how much vinegar was put into the containers
you would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water
further on the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be
this confuses paul on why mr leonard didnt tell him this
then the trna brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain
the color black absorbs heat better than the other colors
one way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum
a based on the procedure the results were not valid
we would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did
and probably her aunt would tell her mom this describes her puting her familly before herself
one trait that we can see in rose is that she doesnt like to hurt people
since they are natural predators they are invading and eliminating the lives of other animals
white darker colors usually attract more light
a python though doesnt need as specific of living arrangnents besides a warm climate
now paul is going to assist mrleonard with his reading
then the lab would be performed correctly
while these animals share this lifestyle in common the python contrasts them
so i think brandi and jerry should go with painting their doghouse white
the author organizes the articles by producing several different titles and layering supporting evidence with facts
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both mainly eat one type of food
you might also need to know to know the constants
also the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers
the types of samples used should be in the procedure
these changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid
pandas and koalas are both specialists because they can survive in very specific habitats
plastic type d had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested
find a way besides tape to hold the plastic
one piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment
facilitated diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane
as college life caught up with him he realized that he couldnt do it
the group was not very specific in their procedures
he starts with an attention grabing introduction
we had no learning center in our school
the students could have improved the experimental design
you also need to know how much vinegar you using you may also need to know how much you
then he has crash course giving examples of previous times there has been crashes in space
for example the category crash course is a section that talks about satellites crashing into one another
one trait that describes rose is understanding
their only food source is where they live
this may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples
rrna inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids
the additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big i refer the containers
this means they have more places where they can survive
while plastic type a had the least stretchability at mm
humans have animals as pets a large and potray source
the effect it had on paul was somewhat like the effect paul had on mr leonard sympathy
it is ultimately the most flexiblestretchable substance out of the given in the experiment
mr leonard sees in paul the likeness and commoness that they share
there is no control so how do you know what water is
they are both different from pythons because they dont eat meet
this doesnt give the readers anything to compare the results
mr leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing
in order to replicate this experiment there are a few more things i need to know
in the fourth and fifth paragraph he is telling information about what has been sent to earths atmosphere
the author brakes down the article into sections
the author opens the article with an intense introduction but then settles down into a serious tone
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is interested and wants to know more
increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on
rose is being thoughful when she doesnt tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings
also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell
pandas only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
in order to complete this experiment three aditional thing should be included
the author talks about how satellites collide in to eachother and produced space debris
cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school
based on the students data i conclude that plastic type b stretched the most after five minutes
invasive means a newly introduced species to the area but it has a negative effect
because paul knew how mr leonard felt when he told him about his past
paul has sympathy for mr leonard because they both have problems with learning
i can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister anna
it is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container
the author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur
since white had less heat they would w ant to paint the dog house white
the reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding
paul figures out that mr leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well
the background information effects paul because it shows paul what mrleonard was when he was at his age
it makes paul kinda in a way want to help mr leonard
i can conclude that plastic type a is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching
facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell
rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college
an example would be paul can not read and neither can mr leonard
this man had given me his time to help me excel at something
helps us understand the overall idea and explains the material in the article
this makes understanding the information easier
why couldnt they just leave it how it was
it goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes
mr leonard asked paul where do you think youre going
because the another are proliferating and hunting native specie
in order to replicate the experiment for acid rain you need additional information
therefore mr leonard could not finish his runnning career
it means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing
the author organizes this article in a very comprehensive way
those improvements would clear up everything in the experiment
paul learns that mr leonard was a great athlete but didnt know how to read
they both like stability unlike the python these animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalists
they also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic
mrleonard tries to help paul become a better student and suceeds
paul learns that mr leonard use to be a record breaking member of a track team
the codons attach to the anticodons of the trna strand
one trait that describes rose based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined
she did not want to hurt her aunts feelings by telling her the truth
balsa wood compared with pine or type or type of plastic
it would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate
the author then gives a breif history on space junk
i prefer this form of organization as it is easier to read and understand
according to the experiment the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic b
this section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it
despite how weighed down she felt she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family
the fourth is called little bits but a big deal
the mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes
i would need to know how much samples i need for this experiment
osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles
this would provide a constant to compare the results to
also for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials
paul was shock to find out the mrleonard broke records back in his college years
the author organizes the article into three condenced topics about orbitting junk
another process if diffusion which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration
if there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily
paul felt more of a connection after he had found out about mr leonards struggles
paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before
a based on the students data you can conclude that plastic
they were introduced to the area and have invaded into the territory up other animals
more trials would have increased the validity
not specifying this could lead to variations of data and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment
he then changes his tone to that of a more formal one
first it starts off how every good essay starts off
then talks about all the different space crafts used in the past years
mr leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help paul so he could achieve his dreams
maybe her life would get easiermaybe it wouldnt
one trait the describes rose is hard working
paul also figured out that mr leonard couldnt read
for instance one plastic with no weight
mr leonard never had help with reading and he failed college
despite these feelings rose tries to remain positive for annas sake and holds her tongue
she said to anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college
and he wants to help mr leonard with his reading
the author organizes the article by having headings for different topics
he first starts out with the introduction to be interesting to get your attention
lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information
plastic b is able to stretch from to mm
once the mrna finds the ribosome the aug codon starts the protein synthesis
pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
many of roses traits are displayed throughout the story
rose to me seems to be a very hard working person
in step you need to be told how much vinegar to pour
third the author discusses how satellites collide with each other
the python on the other hand is a generalist carnivor that will eat any meat
some additional information how much vinegar do i pour into the cup
you would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment
they need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples
after the titles the author goes into further detail under each topic title
pythons eat almost everything and are extremly harmful
this story occurred in februaru when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris
it then transfers the instructions to the trna to start the sequence
these two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design
this allows the reader to take in as mcuh information as possible
the panda and koalas eat resources people need
when he questions him and finds out the truth he says cmon mr leonard
when mr leonard hands paul the url and paul looks him up he realizes something important
because of this crash their are hundreds of millions pieces of satellite in space now
plastic types c reached mm and plastic type d reached mm
paul greatly appreciated that an old star was helping him with his hurdles now
i would need to know how to determine the mass
mr leonards says i lost my scholarship and flunnked out
the background information that paul recieves about mr leonard changes his views
the students could improve their results by repeating more trials
he doesnt just put everything together he makes subtitles
panda from china are similar to koalas from australia because they are both example of specialist species
the hall monitor mr leonard decides to help paul by coaching him in hurdling
paul seem intrested in what had happened
i would say rose is an understanding person
rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is
first the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers
it was mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched more millimeter
it would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type
the first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested
to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples
the information that is found on mr leonard is a big impact on paul
koalas and pandas are both different from pythons have many different places they live in the world
he then explains how satellites crash and how debris is broken off
next the author describes what space junk is and how it was created
this should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time
as the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species
the group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers
rose didnt answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings
it is a very helpful way in letting us find information on a given idea
these two species are different from a python because a python is a generalist species
also how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample
koalas pandas differ from pythons because a python is a generalist pandas and koalas are specialists
mm and trial plastic type a stretched mm
the author organizes the article with an introduction and three body paragraphs
passive transport used to move substances through the membrane without using energy
the trna has amino acids attached to the end of it
a i concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials
then he helps paul learn the hurdles and paul begins to like him
c stretched the second least mm and d closely followed b mm in stretching
based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic b
i think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount
to replicate the experiment the first thing that a group would need is a control variable
when her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this family she did not reply
a the group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample
the conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics
so would need to place something in regular water as well
active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein this uses energy
all the background information on paul is the same as mr leonard
in addition i would need to know what type of vinegar was used
this caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship
the student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied
last it explains that problems are still existing and the amount of space crash is increasing
the very last section states that even small bits of space debris can cause a big problem
i would need to know how much vinegar to add
paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased
together these two colors would make a very comfortable house
an example of this is when she is talking with anna and says anna whats wrong
these changes to the procedure will make the experiment easy for replicate
also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water
after defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made
also specified how high up the table was
finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use
even the term invasive species is unfair
another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample
at first the author brings you in with starting sentence
the black lid made the air in the the jar very warm
they should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in lightdarkwarmcold
also we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open
the author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as grab your telescope
she knows she has a job to look out for her family
when she talked to her aunt kolab it had said maybe her life would get easier
they also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added
another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results
white the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside
she realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed
so the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white
second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants
that is when paul realized that he and mr leonard were alike in that way
when the coach gave paul that url and website to search him
the introduction goes along with what is space junk
to conclude the polymer investigation according to data plastic a is the stretchiest
next the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother
paul could relate to what mr leonard went through and he ends up helping mr leonard learn to read
paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star but he could not read
even though he felt embarrassed by the past
as well as knowing what type of each substance you need
also seeing their similarities motivated paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles
showing that she wants what is best for her brother
the author starts off the article by catching the readers interest and attention
first i would need to the materials needed for the lab
then he goes into the past giving the reader a sense of history
a plastic a stretched out the most with mm
i know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures
then the author gives some background information about what space junk really is
white it was the coolest with the temp
white this color will cool down the dog house
also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added
you will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the hours
also describe how long the plastic types were before she started her experiment
the effect that the background check of mr leonard has on paul is a good one
the background story of mr leonard is something that is familiar to paul
the doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest
the is how the author organizes this article
when anna has a bad dream rose says whats wrong
after crash course the next section is titled little bits but a big deal
but then when he finds out mr leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading
step was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container
she tries to get her sister to think positive about the situations in their family
they would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams
one conclusion i ran make is plastic b was best of stretchability
he felt empathetic he understood the hall monitors emotions completely
he did not want paul to go through what he did
additionally i would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in
in order to replicate this groups experiments you would need some additional information
then realizes mrleonard does this to help other students
it has several food sources such as the key largo wild rat or even alligators
what is space junk is where he basically tells us just a general idea about it
diffusionmolecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration
also dark gray takes in more heat then white by degc average
this section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems
its only been four months rose said as gently as she could
thats been training him on the track everyday
different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently making the experiment inaccurate
it also gives paul the idea to teach mr leonard how to read
the information that paul got will push him harder to learn how to read
rose believed that if she told the truth it would hurt aunt kolabs feelings
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
paul felt closer to mr leonard because they had the same emotions
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
paul realizes that mr leonard is a lot like him
then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft
mr leonards past also encourages paul to help mr leonard by helping him learn how to read
in order to replicate the experiment the groups procedure should mention which samples to use
sodiumpotassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane
she has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister
objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts
having different sizes might change the results
some form of passive transport include osmosis diffusion and facilitated diffusion
the effect that mr leonards background information has on paul is he can relate to him
one trait that i noticed of anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart
you would need to know what materials to use the amount of vinegar to use and
dark colors do not reflect light well instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures
another thing i would need to know is where to keep the material in sunlight
the weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure
results in the feeling of something pain heat cold
plastic a was the strongest but plastic b was the stretchiest
the procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples
in the story the trach coach advises paul to look up background information on mr leonard
the author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space
thus creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds
i can not draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table
paul realizes that he is being coached by an expert
the author starts off by telling us what space junk is
according to the article pandas koalas are specialists who differ from pythons who are generalists
the next day after finding the information about mr leonard
what is space junk crash course and etc
one way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through active transport
as it said in the r esults it had the lowest temperaute of degrees celcius
he should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed
also the size of the container would be helpful
this will allow for the removal of other inewencing factors
one trait that can describe rose is thoughtful
the author grabs the readers attention in the beggining with the phrase grab your telescope
then when paul learns that mr leonard cant read either he has remorse for him
he soon finds out that mr leonard also could not read just like paul
also the student should have tested it three times instead of two
paul only finds out about him when he talks to the schools track coach
another way heshe could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics
when roses aunt kolab asked her if she felt weighed down rose did not answer
third we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish
lastly there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container
the pythons though are addapting all over the us to different environment unlike the animals above
pandas and koalas are both specialist and need specific things to live
it also motivates paul to do better in school so he wont end up flunking
in t it stretched mm and in t it stretched mm
i conclude that plastic b stretched the most but plastic d was constant
she thinks the best of each situation and hopes and dreams that things will get better
exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell
all of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein
of the room i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used
rose asks her younger sister anna whats wrong and if she is feeling okay
plastic type b stretches the most
the background information paul gets on mr leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner
then he explains what the space junk actually is
also we would need to know how much or each sample to use and which materials
for the lowest color white it was degrees celcius
and that mr leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had
it will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture
also she should tell what plastics were used
black brandi and jerry should paint their doghouse black
athe conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from mm mm
thirdly they let you know that small problems are happening but it is a big deal
they have to be clear and actually name them also
the author is very organized in this article
the auther orabizes the article in sections
also i would need to know what material to put in each container
and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did
one trait of rose is that she is caring
create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length
the article implies that we should be more careful to avoid introducing invasive species especially in florida
the last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container
you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the natuinalsyou broke records
the author organizes the article into four major groups the introduction what is space junk
she very worried for the family and that is why she says whats wrong
also rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with anna about her father working so far away
mrleonard backround show his difficalty in reading just like paul
he wants to repay him for all the help mr leonard gave him
one way they could have improved was to do another trial
the backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind
in order to replicate the lab the students did you would need to know what materials were need
the article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope
paul knew how mr leonard felt because he too could not read
the author starts off with background information starting off with facts about the first artificial satellite
according to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside
plastic type a was the most resistant to stretch
they both rely on eating just one thing bamboo or eucalyptus leaves exclusively
the quote already states pandas and koalas do not like meat
a generalist says the article are mans pet
the ribosome says in semistasis until a trna with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it
as she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
the bag stretched and mm that is more than any other bag in the two trials
the author organizes the article according to topic
i would also need to know where to store the cups
exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead
they could of repeated the procedure one more time
paul was grateful that mr leonard had given his time to help him succeed at something
secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for hours after pouring vinegar
passive transport does not require energy the molecules just pass through the membrane
first their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested
in the story mr leonard helps paul become a good athlete after learning that he cant read
pythons eat other animals they are carnivores
they have a section titled what is space junk
black had an average of deg whereas whi te had only deg
in order to replicate this procedures you would need to know
the author organizes this article in a very intelligent way
this procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment
paul takes mr leonard to teach him to read at the very end of the story
the effect on the information that paul has received is remarkable information to him
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know what samples they used
she asks her sister what is wrong and if she feels okay
a third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis
than the aithor stresses the dangers of small free floating particles in space
the next two sections are about how space junk is made and what it can cause
trna then attaches to the mrna matching its bases to those of the mrna
therefore the word invasive is important to the understanding of the story
a was the least strechability and streched mm st trail and mm the second
a plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap
the student should have done more than trials
he then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk
another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break
in this experiment i can conclude that plastic type b was the plastic that was capable stretching the most
you also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in
the narrator is amazed and also moved by mr leonards story
the second section was about what happens when satellites collide crash course
this is because for each trial it stretched the most
the trna brings the amino acids which the mrna lines up to make a complete protein
instead you should have of each plastic to onsure validity
then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about space junk
also make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is surprised
while speaking to anna rose displays this specific character trait
pandas and koalas are different from pythons because of what they eat
iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest
because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot
measure the plastics during the process of stretching
lastly you would need to know how long to note samples for
he sees mr leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him
another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals
the materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy
it changes the way he looks at mr leonard
in both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type
some additional information you would need a control
passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones
mr leonard was a very poor reader and he failed college
on the other hand plastic type a stretched the least
osmosis is diffusion only it is with water
in trial plastic type b stretched mm in trial plastic type stretched mm
pythons would probably eat any animal that it sees
they also should have done one more trial to ensure validity
during her conversation with aunt kolab rose doesnt tell her how she feels
however pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates
you need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers
a plastic type b stretch the most than d then c then a
this is misleading because all polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment
he feels like he knew exactly where mr leonard was coming from
mr leonard is very supportive and paul is no longer embarrased about his situation
plastic b has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in t and t
he then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk
plastic type b was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial and trial
he was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student
black the color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter
so i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
in t a stretched mm and in t it stretched mm
pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists
rose is described as motherly and realistic in her conversations with anna and aunt kolab
he uses these subtitles to orginize his article
he feels as if he has found a way to give back to mr leonard also
they also could have been more detailed about how much weight they were adding to the plastic
pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus
panda bears eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves
the mrna then heads to a rrna where synthesis can begin
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because theyre both speciaslists
the third explains how even the littlest bit of space junk can harm satellites or other space objests
also how big are the containers ie what is what is their volume
the plastic starting length weights added and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
when paul found out the reasoning that mrleonard had for what happened he felt for him
startng the article off with some hurmor grab your telescope
the author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way
he had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems
rose is caring to others and tries to help them before taking care of her own problems
he finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact
also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape
next he talks about collisions in space
it is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the hours
he said its time to start your training
shes making sure that anna knows everything will be alright
this forms a unique bond between paul and mr leonard because they both struggle with school and reading
paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds
mr leonard is embarrassed for flunking out of college
only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life
in order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things
he should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere
all she wants is a good life for her and her family
active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient
so paul now understands why mr l told him to meet him after school
plastic type b was the stretchiest while a stretched the least
one improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic
the author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way
this means that other animalsspreading endangered species will not be introduced to having them there
the author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things
pandas are similar to koalas because they both walk on legs they both eat bamboo and leaves
the information on mr leonard makes paul want to strive more for what he could have
rose is hopeful in the story she realizes maybe her life would get easier
ain conclusion plastic type b has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material
type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you
the author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is
mr leonard then went on to explain the whole situation and this inspired paul
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome
peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured
the author starts out trying to get your attention with what may in the sky
this occurs when the cell dosent use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane
she is very sincere and thinks about other peoples and cares about other peoples feelings
lastly they never say how much vinegar to use
he knew them wellfeelings of embarrassment
thirdly how do we determine the mass of the samples
this conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems
in t it stretched to m and in t it stretched to
this experiment needs something to compare to or else the results are not totally valid
based on the data plastic b is the most stretchable and plastic a is the least stretchable
paul sees that mr leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible
the article says invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity
the mrna is then read by the ribosome
crash course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind
in addition i would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used
pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves
the background information effects paul because now he knows why mr leonard wants to help him be successful
black this color black will help the dog house staybecome warmer
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
also what type of containers should you put the samples in
the three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows
the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar
another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time
but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
rose goes to school and has a parttime job
rose was trying to let anna know that everything would be alright once paul recieved a job
osmosis moving water across the membrane by way of carrier protiens
this man had given his time to help me excel at something
the cell can use diffusion or osmosis if the cell is moving water
he had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read
you would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted what results where they looking for
they also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure
he was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star
when they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein
that means that it is able to adapt to changes
finally cells use active transport which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy
then the information about how mr leonard couldnt read inspires paul because paul is going through the same thing
white a white doghouse would absorb less energy an d its temperature would be cooler
based on the students data plastic type b is the stretchiest
so paul could then help mr leonard just like he done for paul
paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about mr leonard
mr leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that couldt read
paul and mrleonard are just alike neither of them can read very good
section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace
you would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment
evident ly black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors
to replicate the experiment i would have to know the size of its containers i use
a i can infer that plastic type b is the strongest as it stretched the most
a in conclusion plastic type b had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two
also how big would the cups have to be
each subtitle leads into one another very nicely and does not get uyou confused
pythons however can adapt and find food and are therefore generalists
what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
facilitated diffusion when molecules cant move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead
a trait rose has is that she is understanding
they are similar because they only eat one type of food
also i would need to know what samples i am using
paul then feels motivated to train mr leonard in reading
the group stated to determine the mass of four different samples
she is working so her brother paul can go to college
then the author describes what space junk is in what is space junk
also if they should all start out with the same mass or not
based on her converstation with anna rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person
and pythons can kill many different species causing problem unlike a panda or koala
paul is shocked by the news he gets more interested in mrleonard
you would need to know what the four different samples are
to explain what the introduction was about
they differ from pythons because a python is a generalist who can live anywhere
finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mrna strand
this is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat
as long as they are around humans they will survive better
this progression gives the reader a solid grasp of the space junk problem
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
plastic b proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics
invasive is word that means some thing or someone is intruding on an enviroment and harming it
the two produce a chain of amino acids
lastly the author summarizes the article and giving the reader the main idea of the article
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
at the end of the story paul tells mr leonard its time to start your training
passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances
you would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist
the feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class
it tells us some starter facts and other things
the codon and anticodon bind and form an amino acid
in the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo
he then explains other topic like crash course and other little things that fly in the air
according to the students data plastic type b was able to stretch the longest with mm
i would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic
the author organizes the article with titles
the student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type
paul became very compassionate after getting information from mr leonard
another thing the students forgot was the different samples what are they
paul asked why didnt you tell me about this
but he labels is itallicized because he is trying to make a point
they would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in
plastic type c went from mm in t to mm in t
it also makes him feel as though he can give back to him
an example of this was when the python ate the alligator
this shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return
another process is called facilitated diffusion
how much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not
in paragraph paul lists his acheivements as a track star
then the article tells about the crash course
it helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles
she does not have much time to do so and is often too tired to even finish
in conclusion plastic b was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial
he begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention
secondly they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp
when speaking to rose she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation
though space junk is increasing the author is hopeful for a solution
they should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples
she tries to make sure her sister is okay in paragraph
i believe this is because paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading
a plastic type b stretched the most because it stretched an average of mm
based on the students data the plastic type b was the plastic with the most stretchability
without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different
with this additional information one could now replicate the experiment
a in conclusion plastic sample b stretched the most when testted for strechability
she puts her family first in everything she does
for example what is space junk and crash course
he was amd excelent athlete but just like paul he struggled with learning and reading
a my hypothesis that plastic type b would stretch the most was correct
immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what space junk is
paul feels empathy for mr leonard when he learns about mr leonards background information
after she says that rose said that that her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
like at the end after learning mr leonards past and how he cant read
mr leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well
the student could say how much weight he used
give a start and stop time put safety googles on
it would be important to know how much vinegar into each container
this will help paul try harder to learn to read in middle school
in the procedure it does not tell you what the samples are if you need to use
the plastic type b could stretch the longest at and mm
i can see that rose tries to be positive about life with her sister anna
it makes paul feel like he can accomplish what mr leonard never had the opportunity to
climats making it difficult to survive in a variety of areas
therefore we could see how much its stretched
osmosis osmosis is a type passive transport across a barrier such as a cell membrane
for this experiments duplication you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup
when paul finds out about mr leonards past it changes his view of mr leonard
for this experiment i would want to know how much vinegar i should pour into the cup
the introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it
and he was disapointed thet mr leonard hadnt told him about this before
another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials
what is space junk gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is
the same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment times instead of
white the black was deg c warmer then the white colored paint
it also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples
when mr leonard informed paul of his reading disability paul sympathized with mr leonards emotions of embarrassment
which is why i chose dark gray for the doghouse
the other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention
the student can conclude that type b was the most stretchable while type a was the least
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists
this tells me that plastic type b is the most stretchable
you would need to know how much wood limestone marble and plastic you would need
you would need a sample of each of the substances
invasive brings a misconstreud idea of terror to the passage
type d stretched mm on the first trial and the same amount on the second
the background information effects paul because it makes paul want to help mr leonard learn how to read
i liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author
plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type a is the least stretchiest plastic
this makes python generalists pandas and koalas specialists
the author organizes the article in four basic tones
to repeat the experiment i would have to know much vinegar i am pouring into containers
more and more trna molecules bring anticodons to the mrna codons which produce a growing polypeptide chain
however their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true
once they went native they didnt go back
the author divides the article into sections and an introduction
plastic a is the strongest and stretche the least amount
the author starts with stating the serious yet shocking facts of the article
and plastic a seemed to be stretched out the least meaning its more durable
the author organizes the article by using headings
paul didnt know mr leonard was a freshman in college who ran the meter hirdles and broke records
they require a very specific habitat to live
this group left same very important thing out of their procedure
in the two trials it only stretched and mm while the next best stretched and
plastic type b is the stretchiest while type a is the least stretchy
part you wouldnt understand what space junk is in the next two sections
pouring different amonts could change the mass
he keeps it simple but also interesting for the readers
plus if it is a cold winter t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer
the website tells paul that mr leonard broke the meter hurdle record as a freshman in college
pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both specialists
she seems hopeful even though she has it rough
for example the headers what is space junk
paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read
then the author continues on with explaining how satellites become space junk in a different section
anna is very caring about other peoples feelings
the informatioin that paul recieves about mr leonard is about his past career as a college track star
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists
neither of them can read and they are both good at sports
next he describes the severity of this topic
the tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous
in the procedure it should say determine the mass by
the header stating crash course has the information about what happens when two satellites collide
crash course follows talking about how even minor space junk can be a huge threat
after paul finds out that mr leonard cant read
white the best paint color for the doghouse would be white
while ana believes family should come before work and money
determine the mass of four different samples
mr leondard told him that he was a good athlete but not a good student
the first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers
paul feels compelled to help mr leonard with his reading skills since he helped paul improve his running ability
he organizes it by topic such as what is space junk
rose although feeling pressured doesnt want to make things harder on anyone or to hurt anyone
the author organizes this article in a very organized way
just like any other story should start out as
the panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves
the results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after minues
also the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored
if they used the white the dog house would be too cold
hence the mm stretched in t was usually greater for all plastics
the group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure
the background information changes pauls view on the mr leonard
another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp
both species rely on specific conditions such as climate and food sources which restrict them from living anywhere else
a panda and a koala are both vegetarians
i would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on
then it provides a history of space exploration
they should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples
the author oraganizes this artices very well
also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given
that mr leonard was good but not school wise
in the second step how much vinegar should be poured
this is because the results are inconsistant
paul then sees how he himself can pay back mr leonard by teaching him to read
black this color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer
the author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily without much confusion
once paul knew leonard couldnt read that well he decides to teach him as leonard tought paul
one trait about rose in this story is when rose has a conversation with her younger sister anna
consists of information about what space junk actually is
paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read
this is ture because plastic a stretched the least about on average
i would need to know how to measure i samples
when paul gets the background information on mr leonard this effects paul in a good way
i think panda and koalas was same specie
paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete
the author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts
the effect the background information has on paul is that paul realizes he can help mr leonard
she goes to school then works hour shifts after school then helps fix supper
paul was surprised and when he confronted mr leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit
the second is to list the far samples in the procedure
my conclusion is that type b stretched the most
having sections makes it easier to find the information youre looking for
anna could be desribed as understanding
one character trait that describes rose is thoughtfulness
pandas and koalas are specialist species
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist
i think the students should have started out with the same mass
the additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container
first you would need to know what samples are going in the cup
by explaining what is space junk and describing how it got out in space and is still out there
in order to complete this experiment i would need to have
one way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails
she is always willing to see what is best for the other person in the relationship
this way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point
first he explained what space junk was in the section what is space junk
the plastic type to stretch the least was type a with t being mm and t mm
to make this experiments procedure completethree additional things are needed
secondly trna picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome
for example the article says that the pythons in florida are imperiling five endangered species
for example the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers
all the other plastics were between while plastic b needed the with mm and mm
the author starts out with a humorous exploration of a toolbag which is later explained
bad reading skills trained to get good at track etc
having all plastic pieces be the same length
the last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment
pythons are a danger to other species unlike pandas and koala bears who only eat plants
there diets are just completely different
he has felt the same way before and still does in school
at the beginning of the story paul is having trouble in school
so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog
explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used
it is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial to trial
light gray light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse
i believe the story reveals that rose is a caring person
she ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her
you would need to know how big the containers were
the author explains what space junk is and how it is formed
paul wanted to help mr leonard and make him feel better
in trial it stretched mm and trial it streached mm
also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample
he sees that he has become quite the athlete just like mr leonard
next you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster
after hearing this paul wanted to help train him with his reading
next they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves
trna brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis
they both have essentially one type of food bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively
the student could have given the orginal length of the plastics
the author organizes hisher writing into different sections based on the importance of the issue
type d stretched the same length in test one and two
he is unable to read but is a good at running track
the three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis active transport and passive transport
paul seen this and was encouraged by this becasue he was like mr leonard
the student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error
how much vinegar and the students pour into each container
they eat things that take them linger to swallow and break it down than koala panda bears
in the article invasive means something new and different taking over
the author makes everything build upon each other
from that point on paul helps mr leonard with his reading
they also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment
it would also help to show the problem so i would understand what i am trying to investigate
the second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic
they also should named a common value for all the weights
this gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article
mr leonard accomplish much by setting national records and being one of the best runner
another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity
all of the following are to condense the article into areas that focus on those specific ideas
based on the students data i conclude that plastic type b has the greatest ability to stretch
the author organizes the story with easy to navigate subtitles
mr leonard wants to help evolve paul into coming a better student athlete
you need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample
the dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest
and there are two paragraphs in that section
also in the th step it says to rinse each sample with distilled water
i think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid
the first three paragraphs get you hooked into the story and make you want to read more
one would be to say how large each sample should be
they could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment
also paul now has something else in common with mr leonard a difficulty reading
change as goes on now favors the generalist
i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
osmosis is moving water across a membrane
mr leonards hidden past affects paul by making him curious
the author organizes this article by using different sections
another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability
with the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials
it was inspiring because both mr leonard and paul had gonewere going through the same thing
the student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic
and what to use to determine the mass of them
the background information paul gets about mrleonard helps paul to belive in hisself
by doing this it keeps the article organized and easy to understand
first they should list the samples they used
talking about the first launch and the space race in the cold war
also to get better results the student shouldve conducted a third trial
according to the experiment us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low
and students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size
in endocytosis the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material
and with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot
they describe how it is becoming more and more of a problem
light gray brandi and jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray
osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane
there too mr leonards freshmen year in collage he won the meter hurdles at nationals
now paul wants too help mr leonard learn how too read
these are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment
both eat one type of food and stay with it unlike python that can eat anything and everytime
all of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment
in the introduction the author states that space junk is a great concern to government space agencies
the jar with the black lid had an average of degc under the lamp
it wasnt as strong as it should of been on the second trial
as long as paul had known mr leonard he was a hall monitor
with more specific information this would be a well written procedure
the background information that paul receives about mr leonard motivates him in two ways
rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with anna
you could concavely have pythons sneaking their way up the potomac
it is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration
for t it stretched mm and for t it streched mm
to replicate the experimentyou would need to know the amount of vinegar in step
a the conclusion isthat plastic type b has more stretchability than the others
another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used
just like paul he had also been good in hurdles and had trouble reading
plastic type b has stretched the most and a the least
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
that she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong
if these three were added to the procedurethen you could replicate the experiment
defines the subject to the reader so that they fully understand the article
he even asks mr leonard why he didnt tell paul
this is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical
i especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called little bits but a big deal
then the writer tells you about the space trash in the section titled what is space junk
paul first learns that mr leonard won the four hundred meter hurdles at nationals and broke records
first things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers
she listened to anna and helped her get over her bad dream
they are similar because they are both specialist animals
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
white according to the reults the lighter the colo r the colder the temperature is
he starts off with a great introduction that has the ability to catch the readers attention
in saying sections i am referring to the titles through out the article
after reading the groups procedure i was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring
paul then deliberates that because leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read
the author organizes the article by starting with an introduction to get the reader intrested
this passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more
paul discovers the truth about mr leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation
the python is highly adaptable and can live anywhere with a reasonably favorable climate
codons are coded for a specific amino acid
white the lighter the color the cooler the dog wil l be
these subtitles give the readers something to think about before the read that specific section of the article
also plastic type a has the least stretchability
when paul discovers that mr leonard was a college track star paul becomes more motivated
it stretched out between mm in the two trials
he can relate to him in the way that he cant read very well
specialist can only live one areas nway in contrast to generalist who can adapt and live almost anywhere
the least most stretchable had an average stretchability of mm less than type b of mm
the author starts with background information of what space junk actually is and what happens to the junk
this shows that she cares about her family
also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experimentprocedure was over
he learns that mr leanard was a great track runner for his college that he even broke records
the background information makes paul puzzled
the author sorted the article into four main sections
it effected paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder
pandas and koalas are both vegatarians that eat bamboo andor eucalyptus
the author organizes the article really well in my opinion
first i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
in conclusion plastic d stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of mm each
i also saw that plastic type b stretched the most
the next paragraph is called crash course
that information motivated paul to be a better hurdler
the first paragraph the introduction introduces the topic of the article
in the article it says that the pandas mostly eat bamboo and koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves
the author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand
additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material
in this experiment the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure
after being told this paul feels simpathy for him because he too can not read
first the author catches your attention and states the problem
so they are taking out in hrs at the same time
different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results
to replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that youre using
in the article invasive is perceived by people as having two different meanings
one trait that best describes rose is responsiable
biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an unfamiliar environment
by using the same weights we would know that the plastics are stretched fully
they dont state what the samples have to be
then her aunt realized that the family relies heavily on her and tries to make it easier on her
a based on the results i can conclude that plastic b stretched the farthest
she works alot to help pay their way in this country
this information gives paul a whole new view of mr leonard
he organize his article in the way he is talking about what is space junk
he didint know how to read and he was only good at track
based on the students data i can conclude that plastic b stretches the most out of all the plastics
the student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics
this person organizes it by having head lines in bold letters
she is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young
within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space
the author uses subtiles to help orginize the information in the article
this could help make sure there was no faulty data such as an outlier
he aslso includes that the problem is getting worse but agencies hope to work together to reduce space pollution
additionally the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container
they need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for hours
first the author presents the problem space junk
paul wants to pay mr leonard back not with money but with knowledge
lastly i would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white apple material
he then talks about space debris from old satellites
first heshe explained what space debris is in what is space junk
however due to natural disaster they have managed to escape and moved into the wild
also how much vinegar should we pour and in what sort of container
how long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water
the author first uses a funny statement then uses a more serious passage about the begining of satelites
this is because white doesnt attract as much heat
they are not natural there and they disrupt natures balance
this is why i would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse
well after reading the second paragraph we know what that is
thease are some key things that need to be included
in gifts paul learns background information about mr leonard
this article is organized in a topical manner
once mr leonard explains what happens paul understands
koalas and pandas are similar because they are both harmless
another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample
paul feels more conected to mr leonard because he too cant read
second i would mak sure all the plastics war the same length
telling us that he cant read such as paul cant read
if they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy
carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell
when she was talking to anna all she tried to do was cheer her up
trial mm trial mm plastic type b is the least change
rose is a young girl in her late teenage years
they could of also tell us a specific weight
he goes through the order you need to know things
a based on the students data plastic type b is the stretchiest plastic
b in there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material
first you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent
they would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container
this shocked paul at first and made him wonder why mr leonard kept this from him
as the article said snakes are endangering five species in florida keys
it can eat a variety of things it can change
the impact created hundreds of pieces of debris each assuming its own orbital path
pandas and koala bears are similar because they are both bears
paul is very suprised that mrleonard had not told him about how he was a college track star
in the experiment it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size
inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples
the effect the background information about mr leonard is encouraging to paul
rose respects her elderes and doesnt want to hurt their feelings
it would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container
what is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used
the article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk
the subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of space junk
a desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment
he also believes that mankind chose to do what it wants so the species aren invasive
it would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well
generalists eat more than one type of food and can adapt to the environment around them
finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do
after the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome
the author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about
lastly we need to know what kind of containers how big each of them are
he knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud
a conclusion based on the data is plastic type b is the longest stretching plastic used
then he goes on and he describes how he was emabrassed because he couldnt read too
afrom the data i am able to conclude that plastic type b is the most durable
the word invasive is significance to the article because it is the article
when he asks mr leonard about it he finds that mr leonard cant read either
the next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity
these results are valid because of the two trials so i can confidently conclude this
based on the students data plastic type b had more stretchability than the others
once again in others words paul was about to get mr leonard some help with his reading problem
when a new speices is introduced to an environment that animal is considered invasive
i would also need to know how much vinegar to use
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia in the same that they are both specialist species
rose could be considered protective towards her family
as well as try half with weights and the other half with none
he also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel
so for a dog house i highly considered it being w hite
cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane
that talks about the american and russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path
since they dont press danger to people they are similar and also different from pythons
the panda and koala differ from pythons because pythons eat mostly other animal
you need to know the amount of vinegars you poured
from the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch
another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials
rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else
a plastic b has the most stretchability
invasive species are animals that are introduced into an envoriment and thrive in it possible affecting other animals
paul was amazed that mr leonards background information was that he broke college records his freshman year
this is how koalas and pandas are similar and differ from pythons
you would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of
second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers
then they started talking about the race mr leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage
these invasive species are considered invasive because they werent supposed to originally be here
mrleonards were words that were familiar to paul
we also need to know what the samples are for the experiment
how should i determine the mass of the different samples
where should the samples dry warm cold in the sun
the procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first it should include measurements
she says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her
which is quite a diffrence if you ask me
he thinks that it is time for mr leonard to learn how to read
all this information is needed to replicate the experiment
paul can now teach mr leonard how to read and do well in school
it can be seen when rose was asks her sister anna whats wrong
the section titled crash cousrse tells us the problem
the first section defines space junk for the reader
paul understands exactly how mr leonard feels embarrassed
also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples
rrna reads mrna and codes for the amino acids needed
in conclusion plastic type b stretched the most in both trials
the experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar
also a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length
based on the data i can include that plastic b has the most strechability
pandas and koalas are specialists and pythons are generalists
when he found out that mr leonard also couldnt read he understood how his coach felt
the author then closes the article with a good conclusion
he explains every topic in a different section
the author starts with a shocking hook which draws the reader in
the first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space
the group also forgot to mention what samples they are using
you would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it
instead it motivates him to help mr leonard
another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need
pandas from china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both harmful
the first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial
one trait that can describe rose is selfless
so you get a feeling of how rose feels on the inside too
it made paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend
the author lets the reader know what each part will be about
mr leonard could never read yet he broke records in college
these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites
an example of good orginaziton is that he dosnt get side tract
this would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by
the author tells us that mr leonard smiled sadly after realizing what it was
another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp
passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy
also to have the same weights of each plastic
she is considerate of her familys feelings and their situation
based on the students data you can conclude that plastic b was the stretchiest of all the plastics
he organizes it by putting into sections of introduction what does it do and how it happens
one process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis
paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort mr leonard has given to help him
what type of container should the sample be put into
the author separates the article in different categories
mr leonard was just like paul at his age
paul helped mr leonard just like he had helped paul
paul ends up finding out the his track coach mr leonard used to be a track star
osmosis the diffusion of materials through water particlesactive transport moves materials by using energypassive transport moves materials without using energy
mrleonard relied on his friends to help him get by
they are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists
during her talk with anna roes says we have to do our part to help paul finish college
the background information about mr leonard is suprising to paul
she fakes a laugh and pretends everything is okay even when it is not
the author organizes in a good way by using sections
i would also need the amount trials done
then the full strand is split and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated
mr leonard was a track star when he was young
when mr leonard explains fully however paul quickly goes from confused to understanding
little bits but a big deal is informing us about those articles combined kind of
pandas in china and koalas in australia are different because the china pandas eats nothing but bamboo
finally we need to know which materials to use
the first section is just the opening that catches ones attention
based on the students data results plastic type d stretched the most
i would also need to know the measurment
he knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer
based on the data the b type plastic is the most stretchable
pythons are generalists pandas and koalas eat only one thing
there is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment
the articles names are what is space junk
it only stretched an average of mm which was less than all others
a plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics
it would also put what effect of materials its going to use
it then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied
the plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type b
and he looks up to mr leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did
he also was bad at reading just like paul
both the panda and koalas differ from pythons because pythons are generalists not specialist
in order to complete the experiment it would be necessary to know what the four materials actually are
this leads into little bits but a big deal
the student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic
they should have specified the size and shape of the plastic
in diffusion substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane
he could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close
this also gives him the idea of getting mr leonard some help with the learning center
because her aunt has the role of helping rose
if i were paul i would be honored that a former track star was willing to work with me
then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other
another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections
also paul finding out that mr leonard was a great track star has a big effect
the mrna codon matches with the trna anticodon
the narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track
to explain the main detail that the artical is about
these pets however are sometimes dangerous
he was just a little confused on why he did not tell him first
he realizes that someone else had the same difficulties that he is having
paul has sympathy for mr leonard because paul knows how he is feeling
paul learns that mr leonard was a trackstar in college
you would also need to know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use
plastic b was the weakest in both tests
also heshe could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
plastic type b stretched the furthest in both trialsmeaning that it had the largest stretchability
the cell can also use active transport to move substances
the author wraps up the article by giving future problems that could occur
before learning of mr leonards background paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read
thus the word invasive demonstrates a central conflict in the article
rose is hardworking we have our part to do to help paul finish college
robray macinnes distinguishes between the the two by saying that generalists favor change and specialists favor stability
some additional information that would be needed are specific things
this is because they are not used to having pythons there
he shows how things can fall in to the orbit and show how it can effact the earth
after the introduction the author adds some the history involved with satellites and space junk
he is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like mr leonard is
the organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader
he realized why mr leonard was so interested in helping him better himself
osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane
it doesnt tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups
a panda from china is similar to a koala because they both really on one food source
he understands why mr leonard has been helping him
this shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister
he was surprised that mr leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage
he talks about the malfunctions and how satellites were first used
plastic type a is stronger than the rest
the author organizes this article because each section provides different details to different aspects of spance junk
paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph
throughout the article until the conclusion the author says how dangerous and improtant the issues can be
if brandi and jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool they should use white paint
the author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration
ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment
one trait is that rose is a caring person that loves and respects her aunt
most pandas are found in china and most koalas are found in australia
the additional information needed would be the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup
it stretched nearly twice as much as samples ac but sample d was close in amount
in the first paragraph the author mostly explains what space junk is and how it gets there
the next section is titled crash course
rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to aunt kolab
finally the temperatures of the room where the solutions sat needs to be known
the amount of vinegar could impact the mass
he says you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdels at the nationals
it should also tell you to do repeated trials
plastic type b has the greatest stretchability out of the other four
plastic type be was the most stretchable
two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it
paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center
black we can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat
paul is implying he is going to teach mr leonard how to read
in returning the favor paul then starts training mrleonard so hell be able to read
she explained that in the long run and the troubles have settled that it will benefit them
he felt that it was fair to help mr leonard
you would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use
these are three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment
lastly what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment
describes where all the garbage orbiting the planet has come from
they also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections
i also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results
the author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage
rose feels grateful after talking to her aunt kolab
validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step
what environment is the experiment taking place in
first the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
fix this experiment the procedure needs additional information
once its in the trna begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three
is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage
pythons on the other hand are generalists and can adapt to change easily
the author starts off the article with a catchy introduction
paul is shocked by the background information that he receives from mr leonard
in this i think rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person
the author organizes the article by writing about different topics in a section
the first topic he talks about is what is space junk
the author ends the article giving his or hers opinion about what the artivle is discussing
lastly they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking
if placed indoors the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm
three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis diffusion and active transport
this shows that she did not want to hurt the family
the students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container
one improvement would be keeping the starting length them same stating it
the author organizes the article by having a funny introduction
also i would need to know how much vinegar they poured in
the cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell
the procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment
for and pandas and koalas mostly eat leaves and stuff like that
lastly we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container
should i use a lot of vinegar or a little
first of all they didnt tell us what sumples to use for the experiment
paul then later finds that mr leonard faced the same trouble in high school
paul also sees this as a way to help mr leonard just like he had helped him
plastic d stretched the same amount of mm during trial and trial
paul realizes that mr leonard broke high school records in field and track
the experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without
these two things must be done to ensure validity
the effect the background information has on paul is understanding
in paragraph it says rose didnt answer
what is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership
it makes paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems
my second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag
neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy
in the story i obtained information about mr leonard
accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar
he talks about the different types of space junk in the section
in order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add things
so by paint ing the doghouse white the temperature in the doghouse will stay low
she is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members
this section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful
for example one section is called what is space junk
one trait of roses is that she is very caring
one piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container
the article begins with an enticing introduction
based on the students data i can conclude that plastic type b was the most stretchable
they could be specific with how much the weights weigh
at this point it is to vague and needs to be specified
the author organizes the article by catching your attention with shocking statements made in the introduction
they could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps
active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration
they explained what space junk was and how it was harmful
i would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be
then the tone changes in the section what is space junk
crash course and little bits but a big deal
black this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer
this talks about the seriousness of space junk
also this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched not how far they stretch
panda in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist
paul was surprised that mr leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened
plastic type a stretched the least out of the others in both trials
third you need to state the size of the containers
additional information i would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples
lastly i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them
the author organizes the article into different sections that fall under the appropriate headings
the results could have simply been improved with a few more trials
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
in return paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read
this is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal
you need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle
paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor mr leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete
the author continues with background information
we would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup
a plastic type b has the most stretchability out of them all
white white could be a color for the doghouse
one characteristic that can adequately define roses personality would be hardworking
the white ja r was and average of deg after ten minutes
mr leonard then tells about how he couldnt read just like paul
that also could effect the difference of the masss
however there are ways in which this experiment could be improved
to the lowest te mperature deg c for the color white
plastic c shrunk as weight was added to t
the black colored lid is deg warmer than the white col ored lid
in the paragraph what is space junk the author defines what is causing the problem in space
make sure the plastics were all the same length
i would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment
a in conclusion plastic type a stretched mm more in the second than in the first trial
another would be how much of the samples
for example rose said to anna we have our part to do to help paul finish college
crash course is all about collisions with satellites and other space junk that is orbiting the earth
koala bears in australia only eat eucalyptus leaves which are only found in few parts of the world
by doing this i believe it makes the article more effective and easier to read
he worked with mr leonard and never gave up on him just like he was not given up on
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
cells also use osmosis which is diffusion but with water
so that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color
to replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure
we start of with the orbiting junk subgroup which is the opening paragraghs
next we have crash course which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites
she did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the aunts feelings
a python on the other hand is able to live and survive in many habitats
and i would also need to know what shape the samples are
paul realizes that mr leonard feels the same way he does about reading
b the student could have improved the experiment by adding trial to ensure accuracy
in his procedure it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely
in that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another
this is evident when paul asked why mrleonard had not told him about his acomplishments
this makes paul see him in a different light
pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves
plastic type b has the most stretching ability
we need to work at things we think we cant do
paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well
if pandas or koalas are taken out of their natural habitat they will most likely not survive
mr leonard then tells him i was a good athletebut not a good student
her aunt tells her that she will try to do something to make her load easier
therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary
the amount of vinegar that each container would need
he wants to help him to excel at something as mr leonard had for him
next they talk about how the debris freeorbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris
the background on mr leonard has a great effect on paul
as rose talks to anna in this story she keeps telling anna how everything will work out
species that do five things are called invasive
the effect it had on paul was the he was familiar with the feeling
more information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water
active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat
this made paul feel better about himself because he isnt the only on with the problem
finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials
that ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid
a python eats other animals and pandas and koalas eat plants
the measures of every plastic should be the same to start
in the story paul finds out that mr leonard was just like him in school couldnt read
if the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties
rose doesnt want to tell her aunt the truth because it would hurt aunt kolab and her mother
two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags
then he tells you what space junk is basically
the author organizes the article by putting things in order by the title
both listing what topic they are writting about
and in air temperature the average temp
this needs to be included in the procedure
black black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors
pandas koalas are similar because they are both specialist species
the background information help him connect with mr leonard on a whole new level
first you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup
rose explains to anna without grief that what they are doing is the best for the family
in that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off pauls college loans
also i would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container
the author organizes this article so that it is easy for the reader to understand
rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money
the next section crash course describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide
where as the python eats just about everything
he realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined
in the end of the story paul takes mr leonard to help him with his reading disability
based on the results of the experiment plastic type b had the least overall stretch
lastly the effect that they are both helping each other
this pertains to the article because one point of view considers the python invasive
two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching
cells can use active transports which is where there is energy used
the size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement
and also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end
this continues creating a strand of amino acids until a stop codon is reached
the python doesnt eat anything that is needed
when translation begins the mrna goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon
they could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed
paul was surprised to hear how mr leonard couldnt read
also there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end
towards the end of the story it makes them closer
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
they also dont say how much vinegar should be used
rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunts feelings
paul has help from both his tutor and mr leonard
the first codon of nucleotide bases on the mrna match the codon on the trna
with the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold
the black lid absorbed deg more heat than the white lid
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh
then after they tell you about that they tell you how unsafe little bits are
we would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup
paul had the same problem as mr leonard they both couldnt read
another good thing would be to have multiple trials
earth is not used to the rapid change humans have brought that lives complicated an environments niche
a plastic type a is shown to be the strongest while plastic type b is not
by the out come of this experiment you can tell that plastic b is the stretchiest
their both different from pythons because pandas and koalas are both furry and pythons have scales on them
very hopeful for good to come to her life
first i would need to know what samples i am using in order to find their mass
paul asked leonard what had happened after leonard had the best race of his life
mr leonards background information inspires paul
plastic type b has the highest stretchability as it stretched and mm the furthest
from the experiment plastic type b came to be the most stretchable
these cloumns include what is space junk
according to the students results type b plastic was longer in length and stretchable
according to this data table plastic type b has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type a
the author organizes the aritcle by topic
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia by eating plants only plants
finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts
it is well organized in different catagories and topics
an example from the article is last paragraph rose kept nodding
just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles
this influenced paul to work harder at both track and reading
also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions
in each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system
the author begins with an introduction intended to catch the readers attention
during the story the reader gets background information about mr leonard
therefore a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray
white that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time
the introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections
these animals are different from pythons because they are more adaptive
in order to replicate ta experiment a person would need to know a few more things
more trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes
finally in the last paragraph the reader talks about how scientists are trying to solve the problem
paul found out that mr leonard couldnt read like himself
pythons can live in many places but koala and panda have special needs
the conversation between anna and rose makes rose seem like she is hopeful
paul then led mr leonard back to the school with the intent to teach mr leonard how to read
paul refers to this because he cant read either
the background information about mr leonard that paul heard was touching to him
the author then explains why space junk is a problem and specific examples on what could happen
the author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the readers attention
they are native species unlike the generalist python which is considered to be an invasive species by many
also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps
for example step should say take cm of one plastic type
in the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier
the very last section seems to be the authors main point and the purpose of her article
the dark gray had an average of degc w hich might be too hot
paul was surprised to fing out that mr leonard cant read
they couldve said the weight of the weights are used
the mrna settles on the endoplasmic reticulum
paul also began to relate to mr leonard after mr leonard told him that he also couldnt read
this paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space
this is the transfer of water through the cell membrane
endocytosis and exocytosis are used to control the what substances enter and leave through the plasma membrane
there also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water
some of the subtitles they used are what is space junk
also the students could have conducted more trials
this man had given his time to help me excel at something
cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane
the four different samples mass of them and where they were put is stated
they destroy the ecosystem by either attacking other predators eating all the food or destroying the enviroment
neither of them change their diet which for koalas is eucalyptus leaves and for pandas bamboo
when he meets mr leonard paul becomes motivated by him
so inside this doghouse when black it can get hot
the author organizes the article by giving different sections are the article titles
the students need to be more specific on their materials
mr leonard beat all kinds of records and the meter hurdles but struggle in school
and finally you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversation is that shes kind
pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says its time to start your training
paul feels that mrleonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either
the background information about mr leonard helped paul realize how fortunate he was and that he wasnt alone
they will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar
you will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample
i would also need to know what i am measuring the mass ingramsetc
this could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment
one way would to have the same starting length for each plastic
atp is important in taking the substances across the membrane
paul can see himself through mr leonard
you would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup
you will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container
for example the first section what is space junk
the background information on mr leonard is impowering for paul in specific ways
and show us the begging length for trial to see how much it stretched
little bits but a big deal explains that objects in freeorbit is an important matter
he didnt know that mr leonard was that great of an athlete
they start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about space junk
lastly the article explains what is being done about this problem
the name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about
plastic b showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most
the background information about mr leonard motivates paul to help him with something
the author organizes the article by starting off with a very clear introduction that captures the readers attention
that rose was kind and didnt want to hurt anyone
finally the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
paul finds out that mr leonard was a big track star and that he could not read
there are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment
they should also say what the sample is
the background information influences paul to push himself
temperature for step would also be good additional info as well
he then realized that mr leonard was unable to read just like himself
paul is amazed that the hall monitor at his school used to be a track star
we would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment
first is a small shocking anecdote which serves to grab the attention of the reader
white it was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature
a constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid
also i would need to know what i should do to determine the mass of the samples
she also doesnt understand why money is so important to her parents
a third thing the procedure hasnt told us is the amount of vinegar
two ways the student could haved improved the experiment one is todo more trials
this shows that both animals are specialists because they wouldnt survive in most environments
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they eat nothing but one particular plant
black the darker the color the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer
paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that mr leonard had a reading problem in school
the author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections
you can not replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use
they are diffrent because a python eats what animals and the panda koala eat leaves and bamboo
they organize it into subject matter what is space junk
paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on mr lenard
pandas and koalas eats depend on one food source pandas depends on bamboo
four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows mrna enters a ribosome
determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp
two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials
overall the author did a great job of informing the reader about his point of view
so i would our water in different containers and do the same thing
rose seems to be worried about anna because she comes in the kitchens and immediately asks anna whats wrong
they finally could have said what the starting length should be
paul feels that if he can do what mr leonard taught him he can be just like him
all in all mr leonard wants paul to succeed unlike he did
paul finds it odd that mr leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star
this encourages paul to help mr leonard learn to read
i would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar i put in container
finally the procedure does not include a control
the students conclusion would be that plastic b stretched the most
active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient
they could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant
he then use the next sectoin what is space junk
paul realizes that mr leonard cant read just like himself
you would need to know what materials to get
in the next paragraph we read about crash courses
if one plastic has more weights than the another it will make this experiment not valid
i fell asleep working on my essay rose said
with a good hook to bring readers into it
in order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known
he explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky
rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has
both pandas and koalas eat only one thing
addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers
it says identical but does not specify anything else
in exocytosis vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell
pandas and koalas have alot more in common that meets the eye
in line paul asks well what happened after that
next the author really explains to the reader what space junk is
in the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family
one reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them
i would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment
the student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed
the amino acids are bonded together to make proteins
in the story paul finds out mr leonard was a famous track runner in college
finally youd need to know what are the different samples to use
mr leonard went through the same troubles as paul is now
the students could have improved the validity of their experiment by
type d has the second most type c has the third mast and type a has the least
pandas in china and koalas in australia are both specialist
dark gray has trials that are deg c which is hot
you would need to know what the samples are how much of each are you would need
they are helping each other with the things that are holding them back
should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts
finally he explains what organizations like nasa and esa are doing to solve the problem
one conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample b has the best stretchability
paul finds out that mr leonard could not read just like himself
for example a python swallowed an alligator
to replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant
they could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two
another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight
the author organized the article in way to guide the reader along with the information
he decides to help mr leonard overcome his obstacles just as he did pauls
the last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are
how much vinegar should be poured into cup
which shows that she doesnt want to see her aunt get hurt
i would need the types of sample materials that are being used
next what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide
a based on the table below i can infer that t stretched out more than t
finally they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data
the first step is when the mrna releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm
it would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in
is degc if the dog likes it hot in there
the background information also allows paul to return mr leonards favor of teaching him to run track
the students could have improved the experiment adding more trials
paul realizes that you dont have to know how to read to be good in a sport
so paul decided to see mr leonard excel at something to
by telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better
the air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it
not only that plastic type b was the strongest it stretched the farthest too
they both had problems with reading and they both were good runners
also i would need to know how top measure the mass
active transport on the other hand is a process of movement which does require energy
the author organizes this article by giving us some information about space junk
paul was surprised to find out that mr leonard had at one time run track
on average about deg c cooler compared with the averages for the other lids
they were spread then appear similar species
she never complains and is responsible for her role in the family
this allows the reader to always know whats going on and somewhat outlines the entire article
paul said well what happened after that
once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time
paul never knew that mr leonard was in track
this implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family
then they start to bring out facts and statistics
they are both different from pythons because seem toeat meat substances
replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
section explains how space capsules satellites and teloscopes explore space
white the color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler
i would need to know how much vinegar they used
once the trna have delivered the correct anticodons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anticodons
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are specialist species
they specify to one type of substance that is crucial to their survival that without they could possibility die
after learning of the background information paul feels more connected to mr leonard
mr leonard was in the same situation that paul was in
third i would need to know what type of container i should use
it has facts backing up theyre statements
paul goes and helps mrleonard as he help him
another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer
he tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box
it made paul think that he has someone who understands his troubles with reading
the black had the highest temperture that was degrees and the white on e had degrees
without this information the results would be inaccurate
they should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container
they should have also told us what type of container to use
they needed to specify the size of the plastic samples for example inin
in knowing mr leonards background information paul feels like the two can relate now
with the first main point he asks what is space junk
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know a saw things
finally all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier
a my conclusion is that plastic b was the stretchiest
they could have also added more trials to get a better result
he remembered what it was like to be in his position
this also makes him want to help with his reading problems
so crash course talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit
the mrna lands on the rrna and waits for the trna to bring amino acids
she cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the united states
these nonnative species are dangerous because they often have no natural predators in the new environment and they flourish
the author has organized the article by using headers and titles to sort the information
a in conclusion plastic b stretched the longest while plastic a stretched the least
he becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle
since mr leonard helped paul paul wants to help mr leonard
this means that they can not live in a lot of places
and another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control
one way this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents
plastic type c stretched mm first and mm second
the average for the temperature was degc for black
the author splits the artical up into sections each section describing different subjects
based on the students results the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic b
first the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader
as the author continues through the essay heshe adds factual information on the hazards of space debris
in the investi gation the air temperature of black was at deg
pandas and koalas eat plants and nothing else such as as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
he not only overcomes his inability to read but finds an outlet and takes leadership in both
white the color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature
one way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights
the information concerning mr leonard gave paul motivation
she was probably scared it would hurt her mother too
you would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass
she is hopeful saying maybe life would get better
i need to know how much vinegar am i pouring in the containers
so paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways
therefore plastic type b has a high stretchability level
the article starts off with the introduction then to the section titled what is space junk
also to say how much weight to the clamp
mrleonard backround information affects paul because it show paul if you work hard you can reach you goals
passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane
it effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy
i would also need to know what the four different samples were
osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell
you would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment
aunt kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work
in crash course the author elaborates on space junk including a specific example
as this occurs ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein
these are the introduction a section titled what is space junk
he starts out with an intro and mentions space junk
pandas and koalas are both considered specialists whereas pythons are generalists
ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell
then after it leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm
first how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers
when paul hears of the information about the hall monitor mr leonard e is shocked
osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane
plastic type a had the least stretchability with mm for the first trial and mm for the second
one would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in
i think paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this
the panda and koala are similar because they are both specialists
he then asked mr leonard to come with him
a based on the students data plastic type b was stretched longer than any other plastic type
no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
paul is inspired by the information about mr loenard because he to has a reading disability
then he puts the information into different catagories
in order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed
this also encourages him to push himself to be able to read better
they list the sections in order of importance
without these you can not replicate the experiment
when paul found out background information about mr leonard he seemed very suprised
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
three pieces of additional information that i would need are as follows
the author organized the article by having an introduction and putting the information into different catagories
the next for of transport is facilitated diffusion
having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent
different weights would affect accuracy negatively
paul gets some interesting background information on mr leonard
mr leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college
also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency
the dog wouldnt want a hot sweaty dog house
one of these traits is she has never complained about helping to pay for pauls college education
active trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane
white white is a good choice because it will absorb less heat
in the procedure the group does not say that you need marble limestone wood and plastic
based upon the given data i can conclude that plastic b had the most stretchability
therefore it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams
light gray the color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse
black black would be the best color because it wou ld keep the house warmer
they are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track
they could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic
moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept
also the group should use a control in this experiment
by how things happen and when they happen
as a young child mr leonard had distractions and difficulties learning
what rose did not say should how she was a kind person
the experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain
reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports
the background information that paul learns about mr leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help mr leonard
pandas and koalas are both similar because they are specialists or only eat a very limited variety in foods
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
therefore a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse
but then he is more understanding as he finds out that he couldnt read
the author begins with an eye catching introduction
they gave different statistics about the various parts of space junk that was addressed
he describes the outter space with all of the trash floating around in it from previous astronotes
there for it stretched the greatest amount
crash course is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause
cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane
rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister anna
finally in the last section the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced
she cares so much for the other people in her life that she is willing to suffer
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information what are four samples
lastly the author explains how dangerous space trash and space pollution is
the results are skewed when wood which is grams is compared to grams of plastic
the word invasive is significant because it explains briefly what will happen when the species alters an unknown habitat
after that section the author writes about different occurances and the details of space junk
pythons are different because they are generalist meaning they can survive different conditions
based on the students data we can conclude that plastic type d had the most stretchability
you can tell that she cares about her little sister
meaning he wants to help him learn how to read
after the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
mr leonard got helped with grades but it didnt work it was still to hard for him
then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter
i would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers
also plastic type b had the most stretchability at tmm m t
first they didnt state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor
when the coach writes down the url for the track website when paul gets home he checks it out
the author organizes the article one step at a time
the author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections what is space junk
the size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use
paul looks up to mr leonard because he had trouble reading as well
rose says to anna in the story that he had to go
how much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using
in the story rose is a very giving person
to replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information
many species go on the verge of being extinct due to predators becoming more abundant to an area
i mean he had some because he never cried and complained and mr leonard reached out to him
i believe that one of the traits rose displays is optimism
in a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers
one possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial
there are two types of transport active and passive
is the foundation of the rest of the article
after this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections what is space junk
then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel
this repeats with the amino acids joining together eventually making a protein
finally the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something
when paul does find out his story he asked about it
they be at a loss of food and climate change
paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until mr leonard helped paul to achieve jumping hurdles
ain conclusion plastic type b is stretchier that the other plastics
pythons are different than pandas and koalas because pythons need to eat more than just leaves all day
that is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell
it stretchedmm and the second trial it stretched mm
the author organizes this article in sections
crash course and little bits but a big deal
they both only eat one thing pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus
paul gets a little suprised on what he finds out about mr leonard
in addition there is an information about how they determined the mass
the disabled object becomes a piece of hightech junk circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit
so it can live in a wide variety of places such as asia and the us
in order to replicate this experiment the group would need some additional information in their procedure
white will be cooler because in the hot lamp experiment they tested results for all the colors above
if i need a plastic with the largest stretchability i would choose b
during the story paul finds out that mr leonard was once a great meter hurdler
although mr leonard was amazing at track and field his grades declined and he flunked out of highschool
pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists
this would help the dog stay warmer in the winter
what else is needed is to state the different samples needed
if i identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family
first you need to know what type of samples your using
the author gives a bit of information on what heshe is about to be talking about
also he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise
i would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
we would also need to know how much vinegar in ml to pour in the cups
white having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler
mr leonard couldnt read and neither can paul
plastic type a only stretched and average of mm
to replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting
a in conclusion the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic b
so if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it
she asks her whats wrong and if she is feeling okay
these specialist need their warm climates while generalists can adapt
the firt part or the introduction gives us a small anecdote on what possibly could happen
osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane
pythons are generalists who arent very specific in what they eat
a solution is difficult but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space
paul feels like he is in mr leonards shoes when he was younger
without this information our data could be different
also pythons do well around humans allowing them to live as pets
a a conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type b has the most flexibility
learning about mr leonards past helps paul in many ways
this is because plastic b was streched at mm st trial and mm nd trial
the introduction has a clever beginning to draw readers in and then the rest becomes more serious
mr leonard said i was a good athlete but not a good student
rose tries to point out the importance in helping out paul
the author starts with an attention getter
the autor organizes the article very well
in the article it says all they do is eat
the last section is why the reader should care about the topic
mr leonard and paul had something in common
also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics
the experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening
both of these animals need specific food source to survive
and also you need to include designated samples and say liquids or solids
lastly they dont give the names or amounts of each sample
a plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least
osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell
the author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both specialists
they could have also added what to measure in grams kg lo etc
my conclusion is that plastic type b stretch the farthest than the others
in order to complete this experiment you would need additional information
how much weight do they put to the end of these plastic
paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports
the next paragraph is called crash course which tells us what the space junk has caused in space
diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane
the author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites
we also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space
according to the article pythons are endangering five species in the florida in us
he then goes into why the problem is dangerous to astronauts and space shuttles
white the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot
he then added the section crash course to provide information on satellite crashes
the students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials
then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is
how much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get
one thing i would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container
these are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample
he wondered why mr leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place
the author first draws the reader in with the introduction
a way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics
invasive in this article used because those animals were never meant to travel from one area of to
three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are osmosis diffusion and active transport
another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not
the article is organized by the author into sections
paul didnt know why mr leonard didnt tell everyone that he broke records
we would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each
first he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea
cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school
mr leonard was a fantastic hurdler but not isnt very studious
the students need to say what the samples are
i believe they want to show how animals differ with their food source availability
the koalas almost eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves
me knowing these three additional sources of information i could successfully replicate this experiment
the author organizes the article in discriptive paragraphs
once the anticodons reach the stop codon the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein
white brandi and jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun
paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help mr leonard learn to read
the author then goes on and explains what space junk is then how it is dangerous
second the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk
this part is the conclusion and talks about all the problems space junk can cause
in order to replicate this experiment i would need to know many details
in the end they both bettered the other and a way
meaning that paul was going to teach him a little bit
lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample
they also should add more trials for more accurate results
according to the students data type b polymer plastic stretched the furthest
the effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward mr leonard
they then go on to tell of the dangers of space junk floating around in space
this instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type b was the most strechable than the rest
heshe also explains yet the problem is certain to persist
also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags
there for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside
also a python is carnivorous and its died ranges
the plastic that stretched the closist to that was type d which stretched to mm both times
you pr obably dont want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
also pandas and koalas are warm blooded and sakes are cold blooded
the student could have included how much the weights weighed
white white would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot
that signifies that rose truely did appriciate what aunt kolab was willing to do to help her out
this i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab she has all these thing to do
in step specify how one should remove the samples from the containers
its teaching paul a lesson that your education is what really matters
one would be how much vinegar to pour into the container
the background information has an effect on paul because paul can relate to it
there invasive species dont chose to invade but day which threatens habitats everywhere
this is when the cell does not require energy to move
that shows it has the most durability for stretching
rose is understanding while having a conversation with anna
how space junk is formed and what happens to the debris in space
then is gives a brief history entitled what is space junk
rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with anna
a i conclude that plastic a is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials
white white would be the smarter choice because it reflects heat verses absorbing it
they think its a major threat to the food chain and to biodiversity
in crossing over it says but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
lastly they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container
after reading the groups procedure i can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment
but failed out for not being able to read
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because theyre both specialists
one trait that can decribe rose is caring
also if paul succeeds mr leonard does too since he taught paul everything
every article has a differnet subtitle that explains a differnet subject
pandas in china are similar to koala bears in australia because they are both specialists
also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights
once he finds out why he feels a stronger connection between the two
the chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mrna strand
finally the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem
that shows that she was working hard enough to make her tired
another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container
i would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container
that shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart
white would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible
paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing
crash course which was to provide details about how satellies have crashed due to this debris
they are both different from pythons because pythons can swallow an alligator
the carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell
two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what the samples were
plastic a only stretched mm st trial and mm nd trial
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they both are specialists
the author organizes the article by what the catergories are
as a conclusion to the data shown on the table plastic b had the most stretchability
lastly information also needed is where to put the samples for the hours
learning about mr leonards background information gives paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer
the word invasive is particularly important to the article because it describes foreign reptiles in america
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia whereas they can only live in certain ares
then he puts a subtitle on the next subjects he brings up to keep it very organized
rose feels responsible to help her brother
add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment
both of them are like one another and know how the other feels
he or she included a variety of information in each of these sections
paul can relate to mr leonard because he is not a good reader either
thats exactly what happened in february
otherwise the data can be affected without this constant
another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics
cells also use osmosis where water moves froman area of lower concentration to an rea of high concentration
rose is dedicated but feels pinned down
also the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials
the author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment
the background information helps paul relate to mr leonard
the student should have done another trial and have a control group
he finds it very surprising that mr leonard was such a remarkable athlete
she did not want to desappoint them but she was too stressed to work all the time
the next section is what is space junk
to replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for
they also need to tell you to find record the starting mass of each sample
theyre relatively harmless and are specialists
a based on the student data plastic b is the most stretchable
the author closes with describing how dangerous space junk is and that people are trying to solve the problem
this meaning that the first section titled what is space junk
this in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother
the last thing i would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be
paul then supports him by telling mr leonard its time to start your training
one trait to describe rose would be optimistic
one trait that can describe rose is supportive
the students data revialed that plastic a could be most restitence to stretching
paul says why didnt you tell me about this
then at the end he returns him a favor by helping mr leonard become a better reader
comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan and
they are both covered in for can live in cooler climates
they should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on
they both usually only eat one kind of food bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas
if the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties
she speaks about paul and how he will eventually come back to help them
active transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using the cells energy
the two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections
explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup
in conclusion type a is the strongest plastic and type b is the weakest plastic
in order to replicate the experiment the person performing it should do a few things differently
the author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction and three sub topics
in step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated
then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldnt read
two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is
the backrground information shows how similar paul and mr leonard are
the author organizes the article into three specific sections what is space junk
if you use more of one sample than another then of course it is going to way more
from the very beggining the author starts the sentence with a catchy and exciting lead
he might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together
in order to increase the validity of the experiment
mr leonards story has a powerful effect on paul
there are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment
the doghouse would not likely be made of glass a nd sealed off from outside air curculation
he wanted to know why he did not succeed in a professional level or do anything after college
this appears when she is talking with anna in the kitchen after they both wake up
i would also need to no how much of each material to use
paul was also shocked to the discovery that mr leonard couldnt read either
also from the students written procedure one does not know what materials the samples are
the author had three key points that were intended to be explained thoroughly
in conclusion plastic type b was streched the most in trial one and in trial two
well a python is a generalist and eats any thing that is isining and small enough
she tries to comfort others and would do anything for them
a conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type b was the most stretchable of the plastics
comparing it to the others it streched the furthest
he also tells how it is not just something small in space that cant cause damage
rose said we have our part to do to help paul finish college
the author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit
one way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length
because the color is not that dar k but not that light ether
plastic a is the least stretchable because it stretched only mm in minutes on average
in the beginning he has a very good introduction that actually draws a reader into the story
how much vinigar must be poored into each container
as stated in the articlethey can almost anywhere because of their ability to adapt
in the other two subsections they are once again organized by topic
first in the beginning two sections he describes what space junk in and how it is a problem
this polymer investigating lacks numerical data
throughout the story there are times when you suspect that mr leonard is just like paul
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
she firsts askes her sister is she was okay
rose is having a rough time trying to handle school work and everything else
paul understands why mr leonard put so much effort into him
invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area
pythons in asia inhabit climates like that of the us says the article
she asks her sister whats wrong when she walks in rubbing her eyes
then he talks in order of stuff that goes on in outer space
making plastic b have the most stretchability
two they could have had more than trials
measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers
based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most
also to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container
one piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container
this makes the article much easier to understand
it also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period
its very vague so they should add more specific
based on the data it stretches mm while the others stretched mm or mm
this black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out
in the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space
the autor organizes the article by making different headlines for different topics
should it be sunny dark windy hot cold etc
in the same way paul wishes to assist mr leonard to achieve something
niether of them could read and both good at track
for example this student said take a sample of one type instead she cold have said whch one
three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment
another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure
when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color
white it might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse
for example do they want us to use the same materials
paul realized mr leonard was like him in many ways
after that he explains how space junk is created which is by freeorbiting satellites crashing into each other
as shown by the data plastic b was the plastic that stretched the most
mr leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading
in your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color
the three types are diffusion facilitated diffusion and active transport
the author gives an example of when one american and russian satellites ran into each other
stretching on average of mm and plastic type a was the least stretchable stretching an average of mm
the next section titled crash course explains the affects of having freeorbiting disabled satellites flying through space
dark gray the color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm
based on the students data the plastic type d was the stretcheyest
should it be poured limestone a block of wood etc
this makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic
plastic type b has the greatest elasticity while plastic type a has lowest
paul also realized that mr leonard and him shared the same feelings of embrassment when it came to school
the author starts off with an attention grabber allowing the audience to get hooked and read more
paul decides to teach mr leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts
suddenly i realized what i could for him
mr leonard was great at track and lost his scholarship because he couldnt read
in the experamint white had the lowest temputure
i will write about why i feel that what paul found out about mr leonard effects him in anyway
paul could sympathize with this feeling
pythons are diffrent because they are a generalist species
the author starts off by getting your attention the explaining what space junk is
paul is affected by the information he finds out about mr leonard in many way
like when she feel asleep working on her essay
after that he gives you a few references to some accidents that relate to his topic
secondly there should be a precise amount of weights being added
macinnes believes that the term invasive is unfair because theyre introduced
they eat only meat while the koala and panda do not eat only meat
then he goes into what space trash and space junk is
the article is organized with a title and subheadings that emphasize the main points
during the story paul finds out about mr leonards past as a college hurdler
he realized that although he couldnt read either mr leonard suceeded in a way
that would make the hypothesis more true
in order to replicate the experiment the procedure would have to add more details
a in conclusion the plastic type b stretched the most in both trials
the author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk
i would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical container
the introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article
cmonmrleonard i said walking back toward school
leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school
the type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results
finally the last section is little bits but a big deal
also it inspires paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete
he does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact
he follows up with a section called what is space junk
they could have put the names of the types of plastics
plastic type b stretched mm more in the second trial than in the first
one example of the would be what is space junk
space junk should not be considered a minor matter
after all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day
pythons can eat really anything and live anywhere making survival easy
there similar because most species are abundant and they do very good around humans
in the next paragraph they are saying how the space junk even gets there
as shown in the data white is the coolest
they are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals and can be dangerous
as he goes on he talks about what happens with a collision
when paul finds out about the background information on mr leonard he is shocked
the validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added
the author organizes this article by splitting the topics up
i would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be
lastly to repeat this expirement i would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container
the polymer type b had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest
plastic b streched the least at an average of m
also to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four
the author writes if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister
this occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard is shocking
he also wants to return the favor by teaching mr leonard how to read
later on in the story paul finds out that mr leonard was a track star in hurdles as well
well first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting
he shows this thankfulness with his desire to help mr leonard learn how to read
pandas and australias koala bears are similar
after the coach explained himself paul knew how he had felt him being in the same situation
also they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used
when paul learns that mr leonard was a track star he wonders why he isnt anymore
after reading the procedure there were a few things i need to know to replicate the experiment
finally they state why space junk is such a problem
the student could have used more plastic
in paragraph paul starts to change his mind about mr leonard
plastic type b was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length
the dark grey average temperature after minutes was deg
you would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container
osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semipermiable membrane
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard allows him to relate to him more
third they tell you what can happen with all the space junk
so the trait that identified in the passage is that she caring
the by giving the article different sections with different names graps more attention
also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them
the effect is that paul realizes that he is going ot be just like mr leonard
the author organizes the article in a opening support conclussion format
mr leonard is likely trying to work out his own shortcommings by making paul a good student and athlete
also good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials
factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment
pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists
assertive uses energy to move proteins acorss a cell membrane
the risks and dangers are further explained in little bits but a big deal
it is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste
the background information shown who mr leonard aws in the past
the author first starts out with a good attention getter to get you woundering what space junk is
then he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph
invasive species may become extinct of the introduced generalists
the author of orbiting junk organizes the article into four sections
the word invasive in the article is reffering to certain species that are disrupting the ecosystem
pythons have already made the change of habitat to everglades in the us
then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal
they both are good hurdlers they couldnt read and they felt embarrassed about it
chinas panda and australias koala bear are both specialist species
the author organizes the article in a simple yet structured way
having read the article before it we know why this can be a terrible occurence
overall the author organizes the article in an easy to comprehend bitsized manner
first you would need to know what materials to use as samples
when her sister came into the kitchen rose asked what was wrong
with more trials the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate
a panda in china and koala from australia are both similar because they mainly eat one food
then goes into the begining about how the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
mr leonard effected paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle
the author organized hisher selection in a way that flows from one point to the next
one trait that can describe rose is that she cares for the well being of others
light gray this color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature
the author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk
the author organizes the article by breaking bits of information down into its own section
the author organized this article by using subtitles like what is space junk
the third and final section in about little pieces but a big deal
the student could have had another trial
kg and g would be a kings difference on results
you would need the size of the container amount of vinegar used the types of samples
being a specialist they do not like change and would rather stick to a more stable environment
the mrna goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome
and mr leonard tells him about being a star athlete but not a good student
before certain paragraphs at the lefthand side is a bolded subtitle
this means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers
the author explains the problem in the introduction and first paragraph
koalas pandas are both animals that are becoming extinct
diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient
the amount of vinegar to pour this must remain constant in a credible experiment
after confronting mr leonard about the information paul says why didnt you tell me about this
this is easy enough to tell from her reaction when anna walked into the room
paul found out that mr leonard was a star in college and broke records for the hurdles
second you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
plastic type a stretch mm on the first trial and on the second
this data states that plastic b was the strongest
plastic d on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers loose bonding
the procedure should also encourage repetition
they should have used exact measurement when saying to add weight to the clamp
however the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results
they start out my just explaining what they are going to talk about
the third section is whats going on now with the topic
the author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by grab your telescope
the information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what material i am putting in the container
next they talk about how harmful these tiny fragments can be
mr leonard then told paul that he flunked out of college because he couldnt read also
diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration
this makes him want to work harder and then teach mr leonard to read
since i am unaware of how to determine the mass
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
they can adapt to many surroundings and foods
also they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy
you need to know how much vineager is used for each sample
pandas can only eat bamboo and koala bears mostly eat eucalyptus leaves
white white will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors
the last paragraph is title little bits but a big deal
this would make the experiment valid when reproduced
label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data
also they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic
one trait that rose displays in her conversation with aunt kolab is that she is selfless
afterwards paul finds out that mr leonard is illiterate
based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type b stretching mm in t and mm in t
the student could have done more trials or added on more time for the plastics to stretch longer
then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency
like the text says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
paul is shocked that mr leonard never told him and he wants to know why
a second process used to help control the movement is diffusion
he also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution
the author organizes this artcile by first grabbing attention
so he told mr leonard its time to start your training
in the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling
then the second section is titled what is space junk
a fifth is that it should be stated whether or not there is a control in the experiment
she does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings
roses aunt asks her if she felt weighed down
he is helping paul become the athlete that mr leonard used to be
also if they were making a table what information do u need to record
the scientist feels the term invasive species is unfair referring to pythons
then crash course tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother
explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth
the did a really good job organizing the article in subject filed manner
also they shouldve made sure they used the same weights
bobbay macinnes a florida resident and reptile seller doesnt like that pythons are described asinvasive
he decides to help mr leonard learn to read well
a plastic type b can be stretched the farthest
they could have improved there experiment by doing more trials and have the plastics of the same lenghth
he knows that mrleonard and himself have things incommon
this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp
considering the plastic was already stretched
specialists cant seem to come together and agree
the author uses heading to organize his article
and the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk
and finally the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space
the author starts this article grabbing the attention of his readers
the author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used
while training with mr leonard paul learns more about him and his past
a plastic b is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at mm
the words a sample doesnt specify the exact amount of each rock are needed
the one trait i depicted from this passage was that rose is grown up
the next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other
the author organized the article by using an introduction what an attention getter to get the readers interest
different amounts of vinegar would give different results
the student uses samples with varying length therefore making his results invalid
finally this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample
in order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information
i would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen
the main difference between specialists and generalists is that one can adapt and one can not
at the same time paul could relate to him
but as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability
the water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration
you should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need
finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem
which explains whats happen over the past years
this would ensure which plastic is the strongest
so it just showed paul that he shouldnt give up just because something gets hard in life
after that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth
also it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also
i would need the same kind of vinegar in each container
they are different form pythons because pythons are generalist
also what conditions should they be left in for the hours
they differ from pythons because pythons are generalists
but her aunts offer had somehow made her feel lighter
pythons can adapt to many different environment and eat a variety of foods
the author begins by creating the introduction showing the beginning of space exploration
the article orbiting junk is organized in a way that is most understandable to the reader
also in the article the author says pythons were often kept as house pets
the student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh
after that they start with statistics that shock the reader
paul can relate to mr leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading
that is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
determine what the different samples are then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample
another way this experiment would be better is if i leneth the weight that tore the plastic
it describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles
the author of this article organized the paper logically
looking at the students data you can see that plastic type b has the best stretchability
next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another
they end the article by describing how the bits of fragments can cause the earth and satilites big problems
without a control we dont know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason
also having the same measurement size for each plastic
the length of each plastic shows the same
lastly the author explains how scientists are trying to fix the space junk problem
it helps him to better understand mr leonard
paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills
black black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse
they used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk
as the author says chinas panda which eats mostly but bamboo
then he tells you about what space junk is
gives you a better idea for what it space junk is
the ammount of added weight should be specified
additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup
a the stretchiest of the four materials was b with the average stretchincs of mms
the section titled crash course posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk
the effects that mr leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself
paul did not know that mr leonard did not know how to read
a black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog
the student did a good job conducting this experiment
also increase the weight in the second trial
rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset
finall the author tells of ways to prevent the space junk
the author organizes the article by starting off with the question what is space junk
to replicate this experiment you would need the following information
these debris when traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to elite spacecrafts
the author organizes the article in a way of increasing importance
the catagories use were what is space junk
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
type c is almost the same firmness as a and d has almost the same stretch as b
we would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
also how much vinegar i have to put in to each container
it surprises paul and also lets him know mr leonard was a good runner
the student could make sure each test was in same environment
for example the subtopic crash course tells the danger of satellites colliding together
passive transport does not require energy
the author organizes the article by first letting the readers know what space junk was
litlle bits but big deal talks about how it does cause a problem for the arstronauts and spacecraft
at the end of the story paul wants to teach mr leonard how to read
causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense theyve been dubbed invasive
this will give him more control over the experiment
you would also have to know how big in size each container was
based on the students data you cant really come to a conclusion because there isnt enough data
the united states followed suit and thus began the human races great space invasion
this information also makes paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while hes at school
i would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at
the author begins with orbiting junk to describe the clutter of space junk in our orbit
also the same length of each piece should be noted as well
i would need to know what the four samples of material are
based on the students dataplastic a was streched the least at an average of mm
those tiny fragments in space traveling at miles per second can destroy a space shuttle
the author organizes the article from most important to the least important
they can only be found in certain places where their food supply is
next the author begins the section called what is space junk
the amino acids will bind creating a protein
he realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him
the author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the readers attention
how much should you have in each container
but the koala and china panda are specialist animals and they eat plants like bamboo and leaves
paul finding out that mr leonard could not read has a very strong affect
the purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability
crash cource and little bits but a big deal
after the readers attention is caught he explains the reasoning for his introduction
each article is different making the reader able to understand it easier
the author starts out with a good exciting introduction
diffrent sections depending on what the paragaph was about
in the section subtitled what is space junk
a my conclusion according to the data would be that plastic b stretched the most
he follows this by presenting a potential problem that arises with this topic appropriately named crash course
we need to know how big the sample would have to be
they should have also included the time on the data table
when her little sister anna says im so lonesome for papa
the author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way
pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
one trait that can describe rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family
when he hid that secret about him quitting track because of his grades shocked the narrator
the author divided this article into sections
also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate
paul then decides to help mr leonard with his reading
in the conclusion section the author wraps up the article with the main problems space junk poses
you also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are
in paragraph a python had swallowed an alligator
they could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data
the design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights
he stars with an interdoction to get you intersetes in space
both creatures depend in mainly one food source
bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and reducing sources
he felt familiar with the emotions of embarrrassment that mr leonard felt
chinas pandas are similar to koalas in australia because as the author states in paragraphs they are specialists
neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles
to replicate the experiment i would need additonal information
during that paragraph he talks about satellites and what happens when they die or malfunction
paul is shocked that mr leonard was such a great athlete
they both feel embarrassed because they cant read but like to do hurdles
in order to replicate the experiment i would need some additional information
this method makes it easy to find important information about a certain topic
rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing
then he provides the audience with information about what space junk is
we would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container
what is space junk is the title for the first couple of paragraphs
they needed to include what time they started and when they ended
you need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples
paul was all too familiar with the words mr leonard had said
light gray choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color
the cell membrane is selectively permiable and lets some supstances in but not others
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they dont eat everything
the side heading prozide an organized map for the reader to follow
darker colors attract more heat than light so dark gray wouldnt be too hot or cold
it makes paul feel like he can relate to someone
plastic a is the least stretchiest with an average of mm
then he talks about how the space invasion took place
they and both different from the pythons because can survive in more than one place
the panda and the koala both are specialist species
theyre both different form pythons because pythons can eat anything and can almost survive anywhere
it caused some effect on paul once he knew
most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie g
in order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are
the control should be either stretchable or very durable
they should describe what the samples are how much vinegar do you put in each container
osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane
a plastic type b stretched the most during both trials of this experiment
and realized since mrleonard helped him that he could help read better
paul then must decide to confront mr leonard
paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read
the author goes through many diiferent paragraphs and sections
then they talk about how satellites can collide with each other
i would need to also know which type of container to use
what are the sampleswhat is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers
also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing
when the mrna leaves the nucleus it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins
paragraphs six and seven tell you how dangerous space junk really is
but on the otherhand plastic type d only hit and stayed still being close to b
they also didnt mention the measure the plastic be originally
first you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container
also you do not know what the four samples are
then tells a little about the background information
next the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk
then it needs to state how much of each sample
they need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container
i would state that plastic b stretched the most
mr leonard couldnt read so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it
another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials
indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples
white the white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors
cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane
the amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant
when paul finds out that mr leonard struggled reading he was confused
first he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results
when paul takes back the information to ask mrleonard about the article
paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read
paul wanted to know why mr leonard would want to keep such accomplishments a secret
at the end of paragraph it reads suddenly i realized what i could do for him
i agree that space junk could become a big problem
mr leonard tells paul he flunked out of college
in order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container
when paul realizes that mr leonard was a good runner but bad reader he realizes they are alike
the passage is written like an essay with an introduction body and a conclusion
paul who also couldnt read felt close to mr leonard
coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain
this section provides the reader with examples of satellites or debris crashing into each other at great speed
she asked if her sister was ok when anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes
the background information has a significant effect on paul
mr leonards history shows pail what he can become
the next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk
he was curious to why mr leonard had not ran anymore after that
paul is empathetic to mr leonards troubles
i think that the back ground information that paul receives about mr leonard makes paul happy
a conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable
the author writes about earths satellites how they get there and what they do
but the specialists snakes can remain in the same environment
little bits but a big deal describes how truely dangerous these things can be
the students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time
paul wanted to do something for mr leonard because he helped him with hurdles
passive transport also moves substances out of the membrane but it does not require energy
he knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing
plastic type a stretched only mm therefore it stretched the least
a scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment
what favors specialist is stability
one trait that rose has shown is hopefulness
this would have made the experiment more conclusive
this is because the concentration is much higher within the cell
the author organizes the article in four sections
this motivated paul to help mr leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader
you would need to know why you are pouring vineger into masses
paul was surprised at the information he obtained regarding mr leonards past
for instance one of the titles is called crash course
pandas and koalas have very specific habitats and life cycle
next he gets right into explaining exactly what the article is about
when he learns that mr leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him
he also realizes that those two are very much the same because they both arent good at reading
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with anna and aunt kolab is maturity
next we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material
they begin with an attentiongetter in the opening paragraph to grab the readers attention grab your telescope
he couldnt beleive that the an in front of him was a track star
however the article also claims that pythons are generalists
she feels pressure but still feels the need to help the best way she can
also what you would use to find the mass
then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of space junk
this is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy
specialists such as panda and koala can not
there for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white
according to the data plastic b stretched the most both trials
the groups procedure is missing a couple of elements
the first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers
i think paul also felt that he wasnt the only one going through learning diableties
to replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container
i should place the containers while they sit for hours
it stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics
paul may not know exactly what mr leonard went through right off the bat
recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure
in the procedure the samples identities are not given
thirdly they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the hours
these additional steps details would help create accuracy consistency for all who completed the experiment
i was a good athlete but not a good student
following the introduction is the body of the article that explains the main idea further
afterwards the author explains that space junk can collide into one another
plastic a seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of mm
but paul also realized that him and mr leonard had a lot in common and it inspired him
they grab you attention and make you want to read the rest
it talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology
the author organizes the article in order to create a detailed introduction explanation and conclusion
this vesicle can now travel into the cell
pauls newfound knowledge of mrleonards background evokes this generosity
youd also need to know the starting mass of each sample and what the samples are
so that is how the author organizes this well written article
once paul receives the information about mr leonard he is encouraged almost dumbfounded
she dosent want to hurt her aunts feelings so she doesnt anwser her aunt
for example should they be left covered or not
paul is surprised about the background information
plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four
what is space junk gives the reader an idea of the junk thats in space
plastic type a had stretched the least amount in both trials
that paul went to try how hurlding and mr leonard said to come on back tomorrow
biologists however feel invasive species are major threats to biodiversity
when they first met mr leonard knew his own past and found out that paul could not read
it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere
she is understanding of the familys position and is doing everything in her power to improve it
paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is mr leonard
rose is respectful of her elders and thinks about other people first
paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime
he went to college on a scholoarship and broke many school records
the author trys to grab your attention at first
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they both only eat one thing
what he learns about mr leonard gives him hope and makes him want to work hard for mr leonard
if it was cold it wouldnt keep it as warm but not super cold either
the third section crash course shows how the problem began
i would need to get these items in ahead of time and have the right things like containers
b the student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways
pandas and koalas are similar because they depend entirely on their location to survive
the procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials
this adittional data will make the results clearer
for a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable
while i thought plastic type a streched the least mm
plastic type b was the strechiest plastic streching mm in t and mm in t
in conclusion the author is just making it easier to understand
you would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples
the reader can see that this information has a great effect on paul
he felt like they had the same flaws and problems
water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis
a python will eat anything from a key largo wood rat to a common house pet
they are unlike pythons which will eat a more general selection of prey from wood rats to alligators
she wants her family to be well of and live a good life
heshe should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts
i think rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad
he starts out as describing space junk
white the white had the lowest temp
the panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves
what the samples are what type of containers
also to improve validity the student should have had the same starting length of plastics
and he read about mr leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read
the protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes
these both are different from pythons because like the article says pythons are a generalist
pandas and koalas can not live without specialists
marble limestone wood and plastic in their procedure
it turned out that mrleonard was a great at hurdles but wasnt the best student
leonardits time to start your training
then trna that fits comes and attaches to the mrna
the interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about
in the experiment lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature
the first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
based on the students data plastic type b stretched the most
another way is by deleting human mistake by meaning correctly and things like that
they could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct
but just like paul mr leonard can not read
after that they discuss what happens when two satellites collide
he would help him overcome his obstacles
pandas and koalas are both herbivoures and eat plants to survive
according to paul this man had given his time to help me excel at something
make each plastic the same starting lenth and the weights are the same weight
invasive is a negative connotation because invasive species are usually threats to biodiversity
paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help mr leonard
paul feels bad for mr leonard and wants to help him
mr leonard was fanstatic at hurdles in college and was going to go very far in that world
i think rose seems to be caring about not just herself but of her family
describes what it is they are talking about and informing the reader
this inspires paul to help mr leonard learn to read
i would need to know how much of each material will be needed
additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things
then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris
i think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone
these three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment
right now one can only guess what weight that was
but was shocked to find out that mr leonard never could read
passive transport doesnt require energyactive transportrequires energy
all of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know
i would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount
paul is concerned that mr leonard didnt tell paul about his track career before
if these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die
in order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample
this experiment is not valid because the number of weights isnt given
the author organizes the article by breaking it up into sections
the substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradientcells use active transport also
paul becomes curious as to why mr leonard didnt tell him
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here para
one process is osmosis which controls how much water comes in and out of the cell
it didnt say how much which is important
the first big step in protein synthesis is the mrna leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores
that really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph
mr leonard broke records but because he didnt have help with reading he failed his classes and flunked out
so this encourages paul to work hard and learn how to read
and we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar
there are other people that can not read either like mr leonard
do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items
rose doesnt want to hurt her family becasue she is caring
the author expalins what the junk is that is orbiting
paul finds out like him mr leonard can not read but can run track
paul find out that mr leonard was a good track runner but not so good at reading
also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are
they become good friends and because of mr leonard he gets very good at hurdles
the day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her
you also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
paul related to how he felt being part of a select few not knowing how to read
rose is very responsible as her telling anna about their duty helping paul finish college shows
it also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space
passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane
there are many plots that can support the point among which one detail is predominant
one can see that roses life is very busy
you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample
one thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment
all those feelings that mrleonard had paul had the exact
the author organizes the article with different sections all explaining different points
black the black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside
after mrna leaves the nucleus it attaches to a ribosome
the introduction is an attention grabber so you will want to read the article
the author organizes the article by starting with a introduction to grab the readers attention
it has a huge effect on paul and mr leonard
the biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide
his attitude and the way he sees things change completely
so he was going to teach him how to read
after that the author explains three different problems that space junk creates
based on her conversation with anna rose can be seen as mature
who cant read and flunks out of college but amazing at track and had scholarships
i say this because in trial it stretched mm and trial it stretched mm
the author begins the article with a kidding tone
juggling the two is very stressful at times
by having this information the lab will be more accurate and correct
these are informations i need to replicate the procedure
she could just law down and say i quit but she doesnt
this means that they only eat specific items such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves
i should have the exact type of material
he does this first by talking about the orbiting junk and then by what is space junk
then paul looks at mr leonard and says you have training to do
pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively
paul is greatly influenced by mr leonards background information and story of his life throughout college
you can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest
when it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mrna strand
for example the subtopic what is space junk
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used
during protein synethesis the dna is being replicated and forming mrna durning transcription
in the categorie called what is space junk
second i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup
also i need to know what should i do with the containers once ive labeled them
the author grabs your attention in the introduction
based on the students data plastic b stretches more than the other plastics
pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves
when paul does background check on mr leonard he is very suprised at what he finds
instead of seeing some meteor or comet the author sees a toolbag in space
also it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label
in a way the two are very much alike in more than one way
others believe those species are truly invasive because they are disrupting the biodiversity of the environment
i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution
when anna brings up their missed father she blames him for leaving the family
was degc for light gray it wa s degc ave
finally they end with saying that nasa is trying to fix this problem
the author started with an opening paragraph explaining what the article is going to be discussing
after paul learned all of this information he felt empathy for mr leonard
she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings by saying yes
white the lighter the color the less air temperature
there are several things this group should have included in their procedure
two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways
that background information about mr leonard shocks paul
plastic d is the second and plastic c is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity
white i would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool
he really connected with paul when he told he couldnt read
one trait that can describe rose from the conversation with aunt kolab is conflicted
to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers
next it talks about satellites and how they run the risk of colliding with each oter
to replicate the experiment a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample
paul connected leonard because they both had a hard time reading
it requires no energy so it is called anerobic
finally the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry
the additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container
plastic type a is stronger and stretches less slowest then cd and b
little did paul know but mr leonard was a start track runner
lastly at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight
paul was just helping mr leonard like he helped paul
paul knew that mr leonard was probably embrassed because he couldnt read and paul knew how it felt
even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt
when paul learns about mr leonards past he doesnt get discouraged
something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure
in order to replicate the groups procedure i would need some more information
the author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections
they experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency or change in the experiment
they are specialist and pythons are generalist
the author starts off lighthearted and keeps getting more serious
also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample
it then travels back to the mrna and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it
ex kitchen wrap grocery bag cooking wrap etc
pandas and koalas are both specialist species and only eat one type of food
they are different from the python because pythons eat almost anything
it then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion
what her aunt did was take some stress away and give rose a little hope
the author finishes this article by telling the reader that space trash is on the rise
paul really wants to try now to read and teach mr leonard how to read
in try one a stretched nd try stretched
in a way she is protecting her sister and keeping annas hopes up
the aliens will then disrupt the biodiversity if it is not held under control
chinese pandas can eat only bamboo while australian koalas eat only eucalyptus too
rose being nice and not wanting to hurt her aunts feelings didnt give her an answer
then telling you wat makes the space junk
after he explains what happens in space with all the different satelites and how dangerous they can be
rose is a very helpful person and does stuff that will help other people
the student also could have been more specific in their procedure
i think that rose is catious of other peoples feelings
it uses no energy because it still diffusion
both would help improve the accuracy of the results
this was something that paul could relate to
at the start of the procedure we would need to know what four samples we were testing
therefore the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house
then hell get a job and pay for you and me to go to college
so dark gray would be a good color for a dog house
we only have the two lengths after they were stretched
mr leonard makes paul run laps while hurdling
second you will need to know the temperature of the room
i also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass
paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read
he then ask mr leonard why didnt you tell me about this
paul realizes that he and mr leonard actually have a lot in common
also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye
then the author tells the reaeder why they should care about space junk
to replicate this procedure you would need to know many things
the group of students didnt specify what samples they were referring to
knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialists
pandas and koalas reguire specific food only found in ther homelands of china and australia
he talks about three very important probles in space
they both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them
the authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled pertinant sections
many fragments float around that can not be detected
the last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article
one trait that can describe rose is determination
i think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teachercoach
the next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them
one major type of cellular movement is passive transport
she doesnt like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys
paul wanted to help mr leonard like he helped paul because he felt grateful toward him
he also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment
in the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup
paul feels the need to help mrleonard just like mrleonard helped him
a last step should also be included to say repeat
pythons on the other hand are carnivores and will eat almost anything moving
pandas in china and koalas in australia are very similar to each other in many ways
the author also states that if space agencies help then maybe space pollution will decrease
they can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using
another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp
he won the meter hurdles at the natuonals but drop out of college
the python has a wider range of habitat and a less specific lifestyle
this is the effect which mr leonards background information had on paul
they rinsed each sample with distilled water
paul knows that this was the way that mr leonard felt in high school and college
the author organizes this article into four main sections
active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane
the average lowest temperature after minutes a light was deg with the white lid
the problem does not state what the four different samples are
they both very little and they dont eat meat
roses ocversation with anna shows that she is mature
the author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections
in the text it says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples
is there only reducing to ism the sample
also he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to
she tries to be the mother of the family for her sister anna
firstly the author grabs the readers attention
the plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance
i would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used
this mrna is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteinsmrna then travels to a ribosome
pythons can barley survive in cooler climates where they live should be warm
after that the ribosme reads the mrna code
i think paul could really relate to mr leonard and also so could mr leornard relate to paul
according to the results polymer a is the strongest
the author organizes the aritcle to explain everything in order
the final paragraph reads cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school
but it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer
it shows paul that mr leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that paul has in life
lastly he tells some specific things that have happen in space
this story shows that rose is a mentally strong girl
she tells anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college
suddently i realized what i could do for him
another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit
with the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop
fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are
a from the data i am draw the conclusion that polymer b had the most stretchability
paul knew how it must have felt for mr leonard to explain his past to paul
they break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article
dogs do not normally enjoy hot stuffy enviornments
alsothe procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container
this is followed by the section crash course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit
both chinas panda and australias koala bear are both specialists
it then begins translation when the anticodons from the trna match up with the codons on the mrna
it makes paul wonder why mr leonard would spend the time to coach him
one thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic
for this to be a valid experiment we would need to use the same amount of vinegar
another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results
also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container
lastly i would also put in my procedure how much amount of vinegar they are putting in
this keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information
the students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic
i would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so i would have unreasonable results
this is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same
to improve the experiment the students could have done more trials to get better observations
based on the students data the plastic b is the most strechable polymer plastic
one trait to describe rose would be optimistic
the student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample
anna doesnt understand why their father has to be away in los angeles
what should we lable the containers as
based on her conversation with anna rose comes across as understanding
rose is caring becuase immediatly after anna walks in she asked anna if she was was feeling okay
paul works hard and deserves his spot to work with the high school team
white the color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool
all nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem
white it would make it cooler than the other colors
the white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat
under the section titled what is space junk
crash course was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions
thus opinions on invasive species vary
thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature
paul then decided to do something for mr leonard and tell him to start his training
in t it stretched mm and in t it stretched mm
second step says pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar
paul must feel proud of being coached by one of the best track stars
one trait that rose has is thoughtfulness
a specialist is chinas panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo
i would include the materials used or the samples
the second thing would be to increase the number of trials
white i chose white because the white was the coole st in all trials
each head title for each paragraph has an intriguing sentence and then the paragraph has supportive details and facts
during the story the readers gets backround information about mr leonard
they should have told us what to measure the cup with
active transportrequires energypassive transport requires no energyosmosis the movement of water from one place to another
it doesnt really effect the back ground so much
he shows mrleonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked
it is almost a payback deal except paul is happy to help mr leonard
in conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type b at and mm
it stretched on average more than the next stretches plastics
pandas and koalas are similar because theyre both specialists
it gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed
they could have said how long the plastic was when they started
plastic type b stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic
by stating the length and type of each plastic
therefore when he paul learns of mr leonards past he feels a relation between them
and together they can help each other have faith
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
the author organizes this article into different sections that explain about different things
for example it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk
i think the author did a fine job with organizing this article
they start off with an introduction that catches the readers eye
after asking her if she was ok she went and poured her a glass of orange juice
white if the color of the doghouse is white this w ill keep the house cool
another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment
first it doesnt tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers
they need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable
according to the articles they each have specific diets
do just let the containers sit out in room temp for hours
next anna stands up and says rose sounds like mom
this introduces what his paper will be about
the plastic that stretched the least was plastic type a at and mm
pythons can eat almost anything and they will eat anything as long as they get their food
then going on to say how big of a deal the junk is
this meaning that they generally only eat one type of food as described in paragraph
the next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites
in the experiment the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with deg
paul states this man had given his time to help me excel at something
based on the student data plastic type b stretched the most
the author breaks the article up into smaller sections
in conclusion plastic type b had stretched the farthest
also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers
they should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant
this made paul respectful and obedient to him
i would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
white white would be the best paint color for the d oghouse
based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type d not stretching from t or t
also how much vinegar to pour into each container
the first section is called orbiting junk
an example from the story would be we have our part to do to help paul finish college
finally i would need to know what to label each container
also there should be more specific size measurements of the containar
the mrna contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon
last the trna shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another
therefore painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog
rose seems very caring and compassionate toward others
it gave paul so inspiration in life to succeed
next the trna comes and decodes the first three nucleotides
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
the students should also include the temp
they should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container
they both cant or have trouble reading
not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class but he was extremely embarrassed
by doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place
the given procedure doesnt tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers
the first type of movement is called active transport
finally they tell us that this is serious matter and we have to face it
paul decides hes going to work harder in school and at track
the third section is titled crash course
there are many ways that the group could have improved their design
the python however is a generalist it can live anywhere because its able to adapt to its surroundings
then the author explains the dangers of the space junk
it makes paul think that he is not alone
the students could improve their experiment by adding another trial
you should not have to guess what or appropate size should be
the explanation includes the background of it and how it happens
based on the students data you can conclude that plastic a streched the most
we know this because in paragraph rose is very concerned about the wellbeing of her younger sister
we need those information to know how to do this experiment
in the story rose is a hard worker and respects others feelings
the author of this article starts with getting you intrested in what he has to say
next the author talks about how space junk can be created
pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in china
paul understands that feeling of embarrassment
the more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident
there was an indepent variable the type of plastic and there were multiple trials
after reading the group experiment i belive that they will need multipule trials they also need a control
the last section tells you why it is a big deal
the material needed to mention what kind of material they uses
in paragraph paul seems excited and impressed with all of leonards success
finally it doesnt say how long the sample should be rinced for
also you would need to know what size and shape the samples are
thirdly the author transitions into talking about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other
the students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same
ehen paul was reserching on mr leonard he found out the he to could not read
to know how much vinegar to use what is the control if any and
the entire article is about the threat invasive species present to an environment
this makes the article very easy to read and to understand
also there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid
the student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic
you would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used
when mrna leaves the nucleus it travels through the cell to a ribosome
in the side heading crash course the story tells us of crashes in history and gives specific examples
he was good in a sport but not so good as a student
does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results
when paul confronts mr leonard his natural curiosity turns to empathy
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists
paul had no idea that mr leonard was such a famous track star
it also later goes into telling the risks of satellites controlling eachother
type a stretched an average of mm type c stretched an average mm and type d stretched mm
they are new animals that threat biodiversity
which is a centered post or any experiment
in both trials plastic type b stretched farther than the rest
then the author begins telling about space junk and how the government have great concern about space junk
they are moving northward and hold a potential threats to more northern ecosystem an could cause problems
however it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell
the backrground information that paul finds out about mr leonard has a good effect on him
rose while feeling overwhelmed tried to be optimistic in most situations
the student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes
the author organizes the article in multiple sections
in the febuary of two satelites one american and one russian bith collided with eachother
a i conclude that plastic b is the strongest with an average stretch length of mm
overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
his first heading what is space junk gives the topic of the following paragraphs
in order to replicate the experiment i would need to know which samples to use
the article contrasts between two opinions on calling species like foreign snakes invasive
he does this because he is returning a favor
white would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color
then they talk about various forms of space debris
little bits but a big deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft
indicating that he is going to help mr leonard learn to read
osmosis the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
when mr leonard was in school they didnt have learning centers to help people read
also you would need to know what type if container to use
then in the next section the author gives the reader background information on space junk
do you cover the samples over the hr periodor do you just leave them uncovered
therefore black is the better color to paint the doghouse
the first thing is why the students are doing this experiment
once paul finds out about mr leonard past he is in shock
before defining space junk a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced
he still should finish his college and get his scholarship
plastic a stretched the most with two mm
the light gray was average degc it got cooler because the lid color was lighter
the author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way
rose can be described as caring and considerate of others feelings
als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers
paul questions mr leonard about college and discovers that mr leonard had the same reading problems paul has
the student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight
she works way too much to where shes falling asleep doing her work
i think that this helps paul realize that he could be good at something too
the author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration
then they get let down because the comet isnt a comet its a tool bag
to replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers
the black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog
at the part of the story when mr leonard states we had no learning centers in our school
it started at mm and then the weight added on it stretched to mm
they could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were
and this reminded paul of himself and pushed him to work harder for him
the last section then explains why the collisions are a problem despite the small size of the debris
and australias koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves and us also not harmful like the panda
paul thought since he got a little help that he could help mr leonard
pandas are similar to koalas because they are both bears and have similar diets
the author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections
a polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins
the author organizes the article with main points about space junk
paul soon realized that mr leonard was a superb athlete but was not the best student
however we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing and can not overheat
in active transport the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane
its like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her
another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial
they are both different than pythons because pythons are generalists what generalists favor is change
plastic b happens to stretch the furthis in trial
the section labeled what is space junk
the author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk
each section presents a different problem contributing to the build up of space junk
and then he gose and showes him how to read
a pased on the results plastic b is the most stretchy and a is the least
paul grabbed mr leonards hand and told him now its time for your training
the average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic
in it the author explains how space junk is concerning government agencies all around the world
a chinese panda eats almost nothing but bamboo
the author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories
the first paragraph is to get the readers attention and make them want to read the story
some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples
then trna delivers amino acids to the ribosome
how long to rinse it in water materials
supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article
this shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother
the author organizes the article by giving information about space junk then providing the dangers of it
they also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers
paul even suggests he can relate to mr leonards embarrassment of not finishing college
her family needs money and their papas new job paid three times the salary of his last job
he didnt understand why the coach had kept that from him
you would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample
they are different from pythons because pythons can live pretty much anywhere
underneath the title what is space junk he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is
a good procedure would have specified this
i know from firsthand experience that that is very hard work
this is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is
theres only certain places pandas and kolas can live but as pythons begin to expand they live everywhere
they could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting
leonards words were all too familiar to me
to replicate this i would need much more information as to sizes of samples
this way i can perform an accurate best because i would know how large the material was
soon i realized what i could do for himcmonmr
the mrna finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on
plastic type b was the most stretchable
probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler
this would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately
different weights can cause different results
this would make the experiment more valid
a third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this
the author organizes the article in a way that is almost like a timeline
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
the background that mr leonard gives paul
white would be the best choice for the doghouse
in the story paul gets background information about mr leonard
for example crash course explains the colliding of satellites
both animals are different from a python who eats a variety of other living creatures
paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle
then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened
in order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material
the word invasive is extremely significant in the understanding of this article
this takes more energy from the cell and may use enzymes to quicken the process
you also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed
paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with mr leonard
the effect really sinks into to paul that mr leonard was just like him
in the artical pythons areinvading the american south
pandas are specialist meaning they dine on bamboo
they should also include the amount of vinegar that you need
rose says to anna that we have our part to do to help paul finish college
this process terminates at a stop codon
in conclusion scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched
also paul can sympatize with mr leonard which will make their relationship stronger
he finds out that mr leonard and paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self
white the color white is the best choice
secondly how large should the samples be
he sees that mr leonard was an amazing hurdler and he didnt even tell him about it
transfer rna carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mrna
when paul gets background information on mr leonard he feels that he can relate to mr leonard
he then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head
the first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup
and all samples must be put in the same areas
pythons are generalists which can live anywhere because they adapt
rosa seems to be a hardworking young woman
this paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space
but insted is willing to go through them so anuther family member does not have to doo something else
for plastic type d the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same
also plastic type a stretched the least only stretching to mm and mm
paul sees himself in the background information he found about mr leonard
he is surprised that mr leonard flunked out of college
when paul gets background information about mr leonard paul feels empathetic for him
pauls learns that mr leonard couldnt read just like him
paul wonders why mr leonard is still not doing the trck meets still
the rrna acts as a holding device while this is going on
we had no learning centers in our school
the author organizes the article with different titles to represent what they are talking about
osmosis and diffusion are passively transport meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy
the author puts the story in different sections
after the mrna leave the nucleus there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis
different tempuratures might affect the different samples
the first process is possessing a passive transport
the autor begins by getting the readers attention
for example he puts information about space junk in what is space junk
he knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment
making the temperature degrees warmer
also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesnt state
which will create a nice segway to talk about little bits but a big deal
an example with details would be the emotions in mrleonards words were all too familiar to me
finally it explains that tiny bits of space trash is not a big deal
also how much distilled water i would need to use
and they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused
in her conversation with anna she says we have do to our part to help paul finish college
plastic had the second strongest stretchability with mm and then plastic with mm
in paragraph the author writes if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
for each codon there is a complementary amino acid
so paul took that in as something that he could do
plastic type b and c were the second best stretchability
after paul realized what meleonard was doing for him he wanted to help mrleonard out
paul now realized that mr leonard was just like him in the fact that they both have trouble reading
it needs to be explained what the samples are of
also the biggest of all what am i taking this for
one of roses main traits in the story is her selfless determination
you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample
the second one being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs
i think now paul has more of a connection with mr leonard because they have something in common
an invasive species is a nonnative species that is introduced into an environment
this way it will have more time to stretch
i would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container
the third stepthe trna is copied into a complimentary rrnathe codons are read and ready for synthesis
substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration
as you can see the lightest color had the lowest temperature
the paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there
at the end of the article the author tell the harmful effects space trash can cause
thats why i think that what paul found out about mr leonard effects
when paul finds out about mr leonards past he is shocked at first
he should have allowed the them to hang for more then minutes in step
plastic a b stayed stretched from the t and then streched more in t
white white would keep the dog house cooler
this causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space
the python is an invasive speices to the everglades
the third process is the permeability of the cell
this is brought out especially during her dialougue with aunt kolab
finally i would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it
the average temperature for the color black was degrees while the white color was only degrees
the author organizes this article in a text book form
to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container
he finds out that mr leonard was a track star and paul looks up to him for that
each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last
the author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them
pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist
the author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together
well paul dose not know how to read that good
also you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water
this shows that both animals are specialists and they eat food that come from plants
then he defines what he is going to talk about space junk
then how much vinegar should be added to each container
specify the size of the container in step
it shows paul that mr leonard was the same as paul
it makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read
he feels as if all the help leonard has given he should return some of it
for example pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves
that makes it a possible invasive species
in this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane
mr leonard past effects paul since mr leoanrd had spent his own time helping paul with track
the auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
then two rrna molecules start to decode the strand
they are not native to america and they are invasive because they are taking over the environment
even though this is just vinegar their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab
the introduction is very integuing pulling the reader in to find out what is the problem
plastic type b can stretch the most without bearing to
so additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
paul asks why didnt you tell me about this
many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate but paul can simpathize
you would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup
he was once a young boy and possesses some of the same problems that paul seems to have
the ligh ter the color the cooler it will be inside
the author organizes the article by starting at the history of space explorations
storing the samples is another vital area in this experiment
this man had to given the time to help me excel at something
the author organizes the article by sectioning it off into groups so we can understand the material
three what you are measuring the weight in
another process used by cells is cellular diffusion
also i would also need to know how long i would rinse the material off far
a the plastic that is most stretchable is plastic b and the least stretchable is plastic a
whe he does he discovers that mr leonard was just like him
the student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment
rose is caring when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family
the information that paul obtained about mr leonard probably confused and suprised paul at the same time
a second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less
also that plastic a was the least stretchy
trna will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand
they also couldve written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics
in step it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry
in conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic a
and also the site of the container needed for this experiment
the author organizes the artical into groups
these include what is space junk crash course and little bits but a big deal
they need to add how long they rinse each sample after the hours is up
based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type d is the plastic with the most stretchability
in conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the firstthe second trial the first
amino acids link together and form a protein
the group also does not tell you how to way each samples mass
i would need to know what the four different samples of material i was massing were
paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like mr leonardhe really felt for him
next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide
these sections describe what space junk is
is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris
b the student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial
the highes t temperature was deg for the black lid
another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ
plastic stretched the most it had stretched mm and mm
white the tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside
then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes
this leads into the subject that many people do infact care
white the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
a different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup
as we see when he says suddenly i realized what i could do for him
the student could also have repeated the process to find out why t data is different from t data
the doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof made of wood and shingles
after that the author explpains the threat of microderis fields and the effects they can have on space missions
plastic type c stretched mm more in the second trial than in the first trial
this lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere
plastic type b has the most stretchability
first mrna leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it
mr leonard helps to push paul on and off the track to perform well and try hard
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
cells use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane
to replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used
i would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
after that he explains what space junk is and where it comes from
say what sample to use in the experiment too
they also should have used the same amount of each plastic
one would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup
if they werent all the same size the results would be inaccurate
specialists are different from generalist because generalist are abundant species that often do best in and around humans
in trial it stretched mm and in trial it stretched mm
paul finds out about mr leonards past from the high school track coach
the author uses a structure of history cause effect and solution to reveal information
paul thought that mr leonard went to college but he was wrong
now with the understanding that he can achieve he feels reason to pay back the favor
their different from pythons because pythons eat other animals
the students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes
black the color black heats the doghouse the most
they are more like people in they way that they will eat anything that comes across there path
also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample i should measure
ain both trials plastic type b stretched the most
i would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container
unlike mr leonard he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read
they should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well
anna sincerely cares about paul and her little sister and wants to go to college herself
she says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
the mrna will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus
many people have gone through what he is going through
they are invading southern territory and knocking out endangered species such as the key largo wood rat
pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they are less picky in their food choices
there are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it
a the conclusion is that plastic type d is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic a
pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat plants
they both can only eat one type of food
first the author talks about space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched
mr leonard explains that he didnt have the resources when he was a child that paul has now
the snakes he says are are impelling endangered species in the florida keys
as if he knows exactly how mr leonard feels
if says after hours remove samples from the containers where do they go for hours
finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and earths surface
as a conclusion based on the data plastic type b was the more stretchable plastic
in order to duplicate this procedure we would need more pieces of information
pandas only eat bamboo and koalas era eucalyptus leaves
the author starts off with an exciting introduction that very much grabbed my attention
a plastic type b stretched the most in both t and t
crash course shows why space junk is important
it also makes him want to learn more and help mr leonard learn how to read too
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
the event of their dad moving away was for him to get more money
allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than min
he organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics
i can also see that type a streched the least amount
then he talks about how satellites can colide with space junk and be destroyed
paul realizes that if mr leonard can be a great hurdler than he can
temp and for the white lid the ave temp
both the panda and koala are specialists
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
then the chain of amino acids is released
light gr ay had degrees celcius and white had degrees celcius
these animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist animal
for example crocodiles is something they even attempt to eat
paul doesnt seemed surprised that mr leonard was a star athlete in track
after reading the groups procedure i would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment
paul sees that hes not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read
as mr leonard finishes paul indirectly offers to help mr leonard with learning to read better
the effect mr leonards background information has on paul is that paul now feels more connected to him
he was suspicious so he decide to ask mr leonard
when rose is talking to her sister anna she tries to look at the bright side of things
the author organize his article in sections according to the topic
the groups prosedure could use they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end
based on the students data plastic type d has the most sretchability
the python a generalist is extremely adaptive and is not roled to one single food supply
but because its also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter
he finds out mrleonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm
the pythons are called invasive for their destructive habits of killing off natural wildlife
in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use
for example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in
a plastic type b stretched the most and plastic type a stretched the least
to replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing
the last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodiumpotassium pump
the author then goes on to talk about spack junk and its path and possible collision course
and add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment
type d made no change it streched the same amount for both trials
pythons will eat many things while pandas and koalas eat only one type of things
he went to nationals and won the meter hurdles
a plastic type b has the most stretchability and plastic type a has the least stretchability
of air in the lab as white doesnt attract heat like black does
i conclude that plastic type b stretched the most
they should have done various trilas to the experiment
he became more interested in mr leonards past in college
the the author broke the article down into sections
mr leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student
even though its a rough situation shes looking at what good can come out of it
also i may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list
without this section one may be confused as to what the author is talking about
would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry
i conclude that polymer b had the highest rate of stretchability of mm for t and mm for t
paul then decides to teach mr leonard how to read
the data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial
the procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked
it tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space
paul then wanted to help mr leonard with reading in the same way mr leonard helped him with track
paul decided to help mr leonard learn to read since mr leonard helped him train for track
she did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her
trna contains an anticodon with the amino acid on it
i could get any thing i saw and it would fit the description in the procedure
the containers at for hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight
you also need to know what the conditions are made out of
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
the trait that describes rose based on her conversation with anna would be helpful
the students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results
therefore th e dog house should be light grey it is a happy medium
it helps the validity of the experiment
another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure
this creates hundreds of microsatellites otherwise known as debris
even though things are hard for her right now she isnt giving up on things
they both are mammals which make them different from a python
for example from minutes to minutes
they shouldve also done more trials on the other types of wrap
pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves
the trna comes and attaches to the mrna to begin protein synthesis
first the author starts with an introduction to get your attention
and if it should be the same amount in all
the last thing i would need to know is if i can use more than four samples
we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container
i believe that it had a motivational effect on him
type a stretched the lease in t it streched mm and in t it streched in mm
i can conclude that the plastic a stratched the least from all the plastics used
the word invasive plays a very important role in the article
this means they are both dependent selective food source
he was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades
but experiment d have the same type of stretching
and that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center
they dont have a control to show how the others were affected
i suspect that this is because paul could not read very well
one way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size
it also makes paul look up to mr leonard
we do not know how much of each sample to place in the container
the author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other
they are different because pythons eat all different types of food
pythons can eat anything as long as theyre living in an environment that is suitable for them
plastic a stratched less because it was better than plastic b
in the first trial it was stretched mm and in the second mm
without these i could not replicate this experiment
if the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties
when the strand is translated trna will add anticodons to it
while the lowest temperature was deg for the white lid
plastic type a stretched the least in both trials
mr leonard taught paul how to excel in tack and paul will teach him how to read better
it also explains why it is a problem and how the problem is being fixed
then there is another title crash course
you could also do the time at different times
plastic type b stretched the most in both trials one and two
the author gives a sequential order and provides detail with each subject
first in the product it just said pour vinegar
the students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested
the coach gives paul a website to look at
first i would need to know what type of material is being used
in the story rose is a very mature girl
they arent spreading around the world and are different from pythons because pythons are dangerous and spreading
one way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights
this way the dogh ouse would be around deg
the necessary samples marble limestonewood and plastic are not listed in the procedure
on the other hand a python is a generalist
you also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them
transfer rna brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome
also when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool
the author organizes the article by topic
out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b
however you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed
the author puts all the main points as his title
in the story crossing over the character rose is very hard working
one way the student couldve improved the experiment is to add another trial
the author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information
i also would need to know how large each material is
you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water
passive transport does not use channel proteins nor does it use energy
finally it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be
the next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be
in the experiment black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar degc
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
type a was the least stretchable at an average of mm
during the story the reader understands that paul has a hard time reading
college scouts told mr leonard that his grades didnt matter and that they would have tutors for him
he found out that mr leonard also had and still does trouble reading
the temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was deg c the color black
she begins the conversation with anna by asking are you worried
a plastic type b is the stretchable polymer plastic
the author has a very effective way of organizing the the article
the paragraphs are titled by what it is going to tell you
the author also organizes it by the titles of the paragraphs
then plastic type s then c and finally a which has the least amount of stretchability
after reading the groups procedure i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar
according to the students data plastic b stretched the most with an average of mm
he sees how even though mr leonard couldnt read that he still excelled past people in something else
a cell uses diffusion osmosis and transportation
first he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction
this section informs the reader that space junk is a serious problem that needs to be addressed
plastic a stretched the least at only mm t and mm t
they also should have included the size of the plastic samples
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
the amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid
plastic type a was the least strechy and only streched mm for t and mm for t
a plastic type b had stretched the most out of both of the trials
rose has respect for her aunt and her family
a trait that i believe would describe rose best would be persistant
it helps organize the ideas and keeps the same subject in an area
the author organizes this article in to different columns stating with an intuduction
we dont know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used
rose is optimistic about her future in life
the first section is the introduction where the author provides a brief explanation of space junk
he is also curious on why he didnt finish college
another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip
he organizes it by first getting the readers attention by using shocking statements in the introduction
koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and they are different from pythons because
the author then writes about how it is harmful to space and our environment
when paul found out that mrleonard was an amazing college track star paul was amazed
one quality to describe rose based on her conversation with anna would be she is responsible
then explaining what he was going to talk about space junk
lastly i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples
so paul started helping mr leonard learn to read
the panda needs to eat its bamboo and the koala needs to eat its eucalyptus leaves
this shows that she values others and puts them before her personal interests
they could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were
and crash course these titles help us understand the things the author is trying to explain
he flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read
the fourth section is titled little bits but a big deal
he began training mr leonard to read well
first you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about
such as in the sun or in the refrigerator
making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
the material also that not include in control groups
one trait that can describe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring
the reason she cares about her is that anna is roses sister
the most flexible however was plastic sample b
the temperature the experiment was conducted under
and ends with little bits but a big deal
he learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records
pythons can adapt to many diverse climates
the pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo
plastic a stretched mm and mm in both trials which was the smallest length
the background information paul found out on mr leonard were familiar to him
no school would take a runner who couldnt read
while paul is gon na help mr leonard read
this relates to paul because he cant read that well
also in step it says add a sample of each material
paul seemed shocked that mr leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner
a different size may mean a difference in durability and strength
paul and mr leonard have had very similar childhoods
the subtitle crash course provides a specific example of space debris being created
paul was astonished at the fact that mr leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment
in step we need to know what samples
also we need to know what type of environment we should place this in
the panda and the koala eats only a certain type of food rather than everything
pandas and koalas are similar because they dont have a wide range of food choice
paul finds out that mr leonard was just like him mr leonard couldnt read well either
the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space
the ending creates a good givetake relationship
the west flexible type of plastic was type b
it also show how people can help other people
a to conclude plastic type b is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics
based on the students data plastic type b stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability
two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they shouldve included how much weight
a third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid
the plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size
then he tells us how space junk is created
one kind act to another is exactly what has happened
paul then relizes that mr leonard helped him with hurdles and paul can help mr leonard with reading
mr leonard lost his scholarship and dropped out of college because he could not read
also type d was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial
paul says the emotions on his face were all to familiar to me
that he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read
the number of pythons are quickly and began to overtake the everglades
active transport requires the cells energy and exports things out of the membrane
you would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container so the results are accurate
where do you let the samples sit for hours
white white paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the mins
paul feels he can relate to mr leonard
the three topics are what is space junk
based on the students data i can tell that plastic type b was the most stretchable
he sees that anyone can do anything if they have help
the student could also say how much weight he was using
they are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live off of eating many different foods
he explains what goes on that we dont know and that we dont think goes on
one type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is atp
he gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does
so therefore type b and type d were pretty close to one another
this student only had two trials instead of three
first man to make it into college without knowing how to read that should be a great accomplishment
the author starts on a somewhat fast pace trying to grab the readers attention
pandas and the koalas both are herbivores while the python is a carnivore
the author starts off by giving background information about junk that orbits in the orbiting junk headline
the author organizes the article well by putting information in certain sections
i need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample
the author first introduces the idea of space junk and the governments concern with it
the author begins with statements that grap the readers attention and introduce the topic being addressed
the author organizes the article in subheaddings
once the rrna reads a codon the trna with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome
it is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college
then crash course which is about dead satellites craching
this motivates paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the learning center
the subtitle little bits but a big deal describes the harmful effects of space junk
but they are different because of the pythons spread across the remain in their country
i would also need to know what i should use in order to calculate the masses
what size and configuration should the containers be
paul quotes the emotions in mr leonards wrods were all too familiar to me
based on the results plastic a is the least stretchable and plastic b is the most stretchable
next the author explains the danger of the main topic mentioned in the introduction
pandas can live anywhere from florida to antarctica to even outer space
white the lighter the color the lower the temperatu re
first he talks and informs us about the general idea of space junk
b one way the students couldve improved their design is by adding a third trial
also i would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment
i knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was degc
they need to include marble limestone wood and plastic into the first step
then he uses the heading crash course to talk about the different crashes between freeorbting satelites in the past
a polymer plastic b had the most stretchability of mm
to repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
paul says this to mr leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments
in both trial one and two plastic type c stretched the most
also they could have used a different amount of weight
when mr leonard told paul about his background history paul could relate
the second section what is space junk
white the best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white
plastic type a streached the least because it streached an average of mm
c went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out i guess
they would also need to include the four samples names marble limestone wood and plastic
the background information on mr leonard helps him relate to paul
therefore paul understood why mr leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something
the pandas consume only bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
the author begins the article with an attention getting introduction followed by historicle statistics
in the final topic they speak about the dangerous and the threats that the debris can cause
i believe that the word invasive means something like un natural and that it doesnt belong
then the author talks about how in space its really not that safe
this means it has more elasticity than the others
i need to kind the control group indipendant variabledependant variable control variable
in this section the author gives major events about space junk and what creates space junk
he almost draws closer to mr leonard because he realizes they both have something in common
he then writes of how the junk gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue
and lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers
now a python aresnt live off one food so it can live anywhere and splecd
paul understood clearly what mr leonard felt
after reading the groups i would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment
which shows that paul wanted to help mr leonard learn to read
he catches your attention then gets serious
he decides that since mr leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach mr leonard to read
paul undersands now why mr leonard pushed him to reach his goal
much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment
lastly he emphasizes the seriousness of the problems space junk can cause
the plastics also must all be the same length
he simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read
one last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar
but type b stretched cm but type b stretched the most with an average of mm
next there are paragraphs about crash courses with the title of crash course
they could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container
this makes them a very effective invasive species as described in the article
the catagories the author used were what is space junk
then rose states that she and anna play a big role in helping paul finish college
i think paul is shocked too find out that mr leonard broke records
in the expirament the average temperature for the black was degrees celcius
if this happens the competition may leave the native species endangered or even intimet
then it goes on to tell us about space junk
we need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples
the background information mr leonard told paul took an effect on him
when paul learns mr leonards background information he feels connected to him
it turns out that mrleonard had trouble reading just as paul did
active transport used to move substances by way of transport protien against the concentration gradient
they are different from a python which is a generalist and eats more than one type of food
thirdly you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment
the article is organized chronoligically
he also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner
she worries about her whole family and wants to help make life better for them
light gray the light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm
my hypothesis was correct plastic type a stretched the least during the experiment
each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space
they are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and eat a verity of food
one way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials
the two ways students can improvr the experimenta design is to always give it a rd try
i think that he was determined to do better
this gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph
this trait is evident in paragraph sentences and
another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at
the word invasive pertains to the rest of the article in that it is describing the animals
osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane
the author begins the article orbiting junk with a comment on something seen in space
next he describes how these space projects have caused problems and what they are sugesting to do
i would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material
based on the students data i ca n say that plastic a was the strongest because it barely stretched
complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species
paul is overwhelmed that mr leonard has set and broken records at college
the author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way
you would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container
using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot
to tell me what the samples are in the procedure
this type of movement requires energy from the cell
the author begins the article with a common phrase its a bird
in order to replicate the experiment it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples
talks about background unformation such as when the first satellie was launched
this touches paul because he can not read either
how much vinegar should be pour into the containers
he discovered he broke records and asked mr leonard about his past life
this proves that black absor bs the most heat
paul says in the passage its time to start your training
he asked why didnt you tell me about this
once this animo acid disconnects with the trna the strand folds up into a specific protein
the mrna floats around until it encounters a ribosome
cells can use passive transports which is where there is no energy used
paul was surprised when he found out that mr leonard couldnt read either
diffusion movement from high to low concentration
both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport
for step three it doesnt specify what material or what size container to put the material in
plastic a stretched the least it stretched mm and mm
since mr leonard helped paul he returns the favor
they could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights
one thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment
one piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used
there is a disagreement between the pandas and the biologists
paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr leonard like mr leonard helped him
paul can sympathsize with mr leonard because they are both not very good at something
the experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to
when it is warm outside and the dog gets hot it can sleep outside
he had a difficult time throughout high school and college
during the story paul does not know much about mr leonard
pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
paul wants to help him just as he helped paul
pandas in china eat basically only bamboo and koalas in australia basically only eat eucalyptus leaves
the background information of mr leonard inspires paul
third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the hour wait period
rose is very compassionate and is always mindful of others
surprisingly paul learns that mr leonard is more like himself then he realized
paul was shocked that mr leonard was a track star when he went to high school
the student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add
they should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled
white would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot
he could have also included the weights of the weights he added
paul understood where mr leonard was coming from
to replicate this procedure ill need to know the size of the containers
paul was both surprised and upset about the background information
paul had no idea that mr leonard had been a track star
paul struggled reading and then mr leonard helped him with hurdles and track
plastic type b streched the most in t it strech mm and in t it streched mm
paul also learned that mr leonard had a hard time comprihending reading like himself
and since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best
my conclusion would be according to the data shown plastic b has the highest amount being stretched
a plastic type b was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time
the author organizes the articles by putting them in categories
also osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration
they should also include the size of the seperate identical containers which could also impact result
the author organizes the article by putting it in sections that are related to eachother
white would absorb less solar and thermal energy therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse
pandas in china and koalas in australia are similar because they are both specialist species
paul was shocked that mr leonard didnt tell him about how good of an athlete he was
the author puts the information into specificly titled sections which makes this a very organized passage
in this section it says in the soviet union launched the first artificial satellite
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
paul probably didnt have that much respect for mr leonard
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard shocks him
the students could have done one more trial to justify their results
the next section provides information on the dangers of space junk and debris in orbit
the job in los angeles paid three times what he was making here
the author organizes the article by catching the readers attention then informing them what space junk is
by breaking records at his old high school he would go on to collage and run track
caringrose asks her sister what is wrong and if she feels okay
i would need to know several things before replicating this job
the first main sectiontitled what is space junk
a conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic b has the most stretchability
and probably her aunt would tell her mother
instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself
a conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type b is the best plastic in this experiment
how much vinegar you pour into the cups
he wants mr leonhard to do the same he did
also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy
you need something like a scale to determine the mass
he does this with the heading what is space junk
paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him
mr leonards background effects paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self
when he found out about this information he was very empethetic
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals
pythons however dont need special things to live
the darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer
black was an average of and light gray was
to replicate this experiment i would have to know how much vinegar to poor
the third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane
paul was going to teach mr leonard to read
explain what the four different samples would be
so it seems rose may have to step up and help out
it also makes him feel like he can acheive things that he didnt know he could
the author organizes the article very well
i need to pour on each of pour seperate but dentical containers
the hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with aunt kolab
when paul received information about mr leonard he was shocked
koalas the article states eats eucalyptus almost exclusively
also the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction
rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story
when paul finds out mr leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped
rose seems very caring and always think about others
in step they say determine mass of four different samples
rose does not want to hurt her family therefore she is caring
suddenly i realized what i could do for him
by doing this he shows the differnet topices
so all in all i think that paul is doing this for mr leonard
paul is puzzled by the information that he finds
the author brings us to the answer with the section little bits but a big deal
therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less
naturally he progressed how space junk developed into a problem for space explorers in crash course
giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing
first you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers
the author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article
depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found
the author organizes the article in different sections
lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in
this is what we must know to replicate this experiment
they are both different from a python because a python is a generalist while pandas and koalas are specialists
but pythons are animals that are harmful and that will eat a crocodile if they wanted to
rosa was kind to aunt kolab when she didnt answer the question
what type of vinegar it is should also be included
in order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure
this information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment
paul sympathizes with him because he has a hard time reading too
this is because on average it stretched mm in length
it shows paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life
then the author explains what space junk really is and how things become space junk
such as in the subheadding of crash course it talks about our satellites colliding with russia
without the table a lot wouldnt be known by looking just at the procedure
after that the author finishes up but without a specific conclusion
in this type of transport the cell does not use energy
paul towards the end of the story is informed that mr leonard was a college track star
the last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be
another one is osmosis which regulates what water moleucles can go in and out of the cell
she is also protrayed as very realistic
paul then realizes what he could do for mr l
this information impacts paul greatly in the story
this clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm
crash course tells people about some crashes that have happened while in space
an example would be the python in the everglades
a i conclude that plastic type b has the highest amount of stretchability
he also didnt know how to read and was becoming a great athlete
finally he concludes by saying that the space junk will continue to increase until a solution is found
unspokingly mr leonard has gone through the same trouble that paul is currently facing
paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does
and like how mr leonard had helped him paul decides to help mr leonard
he said he couldnt read and that he flunked college because of it
though it didnt seem like a problem then
she shows compasion whe she was talking to her aunt kolab
the author ends by explaining how space junk poses a big problem
he describes many of the passages by showing what can happen
plastic type b stretched the most of all
directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass
both pandas and koalas are extreme specialists
paul finds out that mr leonard used to be a track star
this group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment
since mr leonard helped him he will help mr leonard
there a ribosome reads the code on the mrna
they should mention add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap
so we can see how far the plastics stretched and how many weights were used
in the second trial plastic type b stretched mm
you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
she always no matter what situation she is going through is hopeful
they begins as pets but somehows escape into the wild
you also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in
paul feels sympathetic for mr leonard when he finds out that mr leonard can not read
at the end of the stroy paul tells mr leonard its time for him to start his training
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
you should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions
he could of also told how heavy the weights were
paul is helping mr leonard after mr leonard helped him
he was intrigued by the efforts of mr leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out
every weight they add should be the same
also the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched
mr leonard said i remember best race of my life
they are specialists pandas only eat bamboo and koalas just eat eucalyptus leaves
so that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse
this statement made by paul shows that the background information that was given touched paul emotionally
there should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment
however aunt kolab is very understanding and talks through the situation with her niece
the final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships and how ships can not avoid it easily
there are several pieces of information that i would need to replicate this experiment
no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
white the white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse
so by stated facts with dates it makes it more interesting
so paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return
as you can see the conclusion i drew and why it is an accurate one
to replicate the experiment i would need to know the samples that i will be using
thhe author gives us information on the topic and little history behind it
in her conversation with anna rose appears to be really hopeful
panda bears and koala bears are similar because they both eat one specific thing
type c streched mm in t but in t strech only mm
and so therefore paul wanted to help mr leonard how to read
the author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine
paul found out that mr leonard had starred in college track
these help to move different things across a cell
my conclusion is that based on the data plastic b has the most stretchability
one trait that rose demonstrates is that she is hard working
in step they do not say the size of the container they just said you need them
you would need to know what samples you would need to use
do you feel weighed down by what youre doing to help this family
fourthly the say why such a little thing can be a big problem
paul wonders why mr leonard didnt continue in track and field after that race
what is space junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there
pythons are an example of invasive species
plastic type b streched the furthest at mm st trail and mm the second trial
one trait rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork
it can use endocytosis to bring substances into the cell or exocytosis to push substances out
also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers
crash course and little bits but a big deal
i would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container
the group wasnt very specific for example they didnt say what temp
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
the author organizes the article by first grabbing the readers attention with the sentence grab your telescope
also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic
this is because both have stuggled with reading
to replicate this experiment i would need to know more information
first the aurthor grabbed the readers attention
one trait that can describe rose would be concern
these codons code for specific amino acids
the author starts the article with an attention getter
it turns out mr leonard wasnt a good reader either and flunked out of college
he was surprised at at how mr leonard had never shared his elite college hurdling experience
type b stretched the farthest thant the others in that minute period
i would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended
thirdly the author explains how satellites collide in space and become space junk
based on the students data plastic b stretched more
a panda and a koala bear are similar because they pretty much each only one specific thing
paul read mr grabowski website and finally figured out that he couldnt read either
how many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass
after that the author describes how satellites die and crash into each other creating microdebris
paul also realized that mr leonard helped him become so good at something
dark gray this color would keep the temperature just ri ght
mr leonard didnt have learning centers paul realized how blessed he really was
the background information makes paul want to help mr leonard because he feels the same way
in this article invasive means living in an environment where an organism shouldnt be
the word invasive in this sense means invading the homeland of another and taking over
second they tell you what space junk is
rose talks to her until she exits to bed
how much vinegar to put in the container say if there was any repeating the trial
the anticodons are joined by amino acids
she didnt tell her aunt how she fell because she didnt want to hurt her feelings
light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature
to be able to replicate this experiment the group would need to add what each sample is
this simply increases the respect he has for him
paul was more than happy to help his new freind
in the passage the author states rose kept nodding
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
the author starts by getting the reader excited
paul learns that mr leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years
the author for example talks about an american and russian satellite colliding into each other
through learning this paul is able to empathize
these additional steps would make the procedure better
you should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system
they could have added some sort of control and added one more trial
they also never listed the materials that needed to be used
this shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it
this has an overwhelming difference of degc after just minutes
paul is sempathtic and wants to help mrleonard to read
after that how little bits can make a big deal later on
the anticodons break off so that only the amino acid remains
both pandas and koala bears eat plants
however when paul learns mr leonard is illiterate he feels sympathetic because they have a common condition
paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesnt learn to read
not only does she care about school and doing her best she cares about her family
invasive means a lot to this article
so paul took him down to the learning center so mr leonard could know how to read
in the converstation between rose and anna a reader can depict that rose is caring of others
how much vinegar should we put in the containers
when she was talking to her aunt it said rose didnt answer
you would need to know that so the experiment will be the same
they also dont say how much should the samples weigh
the panda the koalas are also both herbovores that eat mainly exclusively plant
this shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help
crash course talks about how space junk may interfer with spacecrafts and other object
then he explain more clearly about space junk in the what is space junk
the background information about mr leonard has an astronomical effect on paul
it reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading
he explains how satellites ran into eachotherr and caused hundreds of peices of debris in the air
paul then starts tutoring mr leonard in reading while mr leonard coaches paul in track
putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag
this makes paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete
another is to let the clam hang for minutes
the article starts out with definition what is space junk
paul had the same problem as mr leonard
the author tells of how years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside earths atmosphere
this section informs the reader on how the debris gets into space and what exactly space junk is
by doing this they are letting you know specific information about space junk
dark gray it will be warm inside the doghouse but not too warm
at frist paul is pround for mr leonard because he broke records in collage
an example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis
he concludes with why these issues matter and how people should work to confront them
the movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradientpassive transport
also the trials have different results of type a from trial plastic type a stretched
they could have specified which plastics they used not just abc d
paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about mr leonard
simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient
the effect that the backround information had on paul was exciting
another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type
paul takes this information as an encouragement
white white will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse
based on the results plastic b stretched the most than dca
the reader gets background on mr leonard from a track website that the coach gave him to look up
she tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize
knowing this paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously
mr leonard was a college freshman who won the meter hurdles and broke school records for it
finally they going into different section of how space junk is dangerous
firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment
the author also goes in chronilogical order
as you can see in the data table plastic type b stretched mm in the st trial
plastic type b stretched the most with mm and mm
leonaredi said walking back toward school
anna cares about other people even when it causes stress for her
the author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come
to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant
this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house
you feel that she really cares for her family and doesnt want to upset anyone
the ribosome moves down the trna strand
the amino acids form a chain on the trna forming a protein
as the article said they eat only one kind of food and live in only one place
he knows hes not the only person that cant read
another way is by facilitated diffusion
in short invasive is passing judgement over the reptiles saying theyre invasive
finally i would need to know what type of containers to use plastic cups
this is proven because in each trial white had the lowest temperature
i think that invasive is a passing judgment
the author also uses varies fact throughout the article
the author also continues to use headings to demonstrate diferent parts of the article
when paul goes to the track coach the coach tells paul to look up the name grabowski
pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves rarely
also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples
from there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly
this shows she is atleast giving it a shot
the students also need to use the same table for all four plastics
the author then shows an example of two satellites crashing into each other and an example of microdebris
the author organizes this article under different headings
the author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say
he talks about what the big fuss is with the space junk and how it is increasing
the author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers eye
another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic
when that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids
also i can draw the conclusion that type a stretched the least after both trials
eventually paul was able to join the track team
also there should have been more than two trials
for the plastic c and d they are inbetween and c is close to a
also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment
to get the reader involved and to provide factual information
then he explains space elxploration then talks about satellites and finally explains the danger of space junk
the goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium and have everything balanced
the mrna leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm
second we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers
the student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to
however mr leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldnt read
section two talks about what space junk is
if the sizes vary the data found is useless
but pandas and koalas can only live in china and australia due to the plants they eat
it really depends on where t he people live and on the season
the sodiumpotassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane
on the second trial plastic b stretched mm and the next closes was plastic type d which stretched mm
based on the results founded it can be concluded that plastic type b was the stretchiest
she is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding
they are killing off natural animals such as the key largo wood rat
improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid
the group needs to include each specific in their conclusion
he organizes this article by breaking it up on diffrent topics of the same subject
these students could have improved in a lot of things
pandas in china are similar to koala in australia because they both herbivores
they have chosen one main point which is space junk and created a few subtopics
it would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used
this signals the end of protein synthesis
the author organizes the article by putting side heading into the story
i also need to know how to find the difference in mass
the beginning is a introduction or attention grabber to get you ready to read the reportstory
pandas in china koalas in australia are similar bc they both depend on their environment to survive
first thing the mrna does is go to the ribosome
the darker the color of the lid got the warmer the inside of the jar was
the second step is for the mrna to be copied to trna
third there is no control in this experiment
you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer
this could also effect the mass of the material
both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class
obviously it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article
crash course and little bits but a big deal
another way that it couldve been improved was to do more trials
she helps tries to help out with the money situation by working
in the introduction the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way
also i would need to know if i am letting the samples dry in the sun or not
pual had a reading problum which caused him to do poorly in school
the first trna floats away leaving the amino acid behind
the first stepis mrna connects to the ribosome to keep it in place
at least she feels responsible for everyone
the background information makes paul feel as though mr leonard understands his problems
one way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials
i might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material
if they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached
he understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps mr leonard to read
the pandas in china and koalas of australia are similar because they are both specialists
these proteins are surrounded by polar heads and nonfatty acid tails
he realizes that mr leonard fully understands paul and that hes trying to give paul confidence to succeed
lastly i would want to know the acidity of the acidakavinegar
pandas and koalas have similar ways to animals life
conclusion plastics bd stretch significantly more than plastics ac
the background information made paul wonder why mr leonard was a hall monitor
diffusion which lets small proteins in and outfacilated diffusion which lets larger proteins in and out
another improvement wold be more trials
each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs
i would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment
when paul finds out about mr leonards past paul feels like he can relate to this
first the writer grabs your attention with the introduction
also adding a control would be helpful as well
paul first wants to know why mr leonard did not tell him about it
he never expected that mr leonard was a track star
crash course little bits but a big deal
in summer you wouldnt wan t the dog house to be overheated
that is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with
the united states followed suit and thus began the human races great space invasion
he also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic
then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is
the author organizes the artical by subtitles
the space junk can create disastrous holes in an object moving through space
the emotions in mr leonards words were all to familiar to me
the student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined
he now feels like he fits in with mr leonard since they share the same problem
paul decided to help mr leonard learn how to read
and lastly they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment
information i would need to replicate i mass samples
this is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team
he organizes it by putting in a certain order
a control one with just pure water is needed to increase validity
twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second
second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar
white in the experament the color white absorbed less heat
this help him to practice runnung and he help mrleonard to practice reading
the significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem
mrna leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis
a based on the students data i can conclude that plastic b has the most stretchability
rose couldnt answer in fear of hurting her aunt or her mother
paul says you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
it gave paul the bright idea to help mr leonard read
white white would make the dog house less hot
he had no idea that mr leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before
paul is very impressed by mr leonards track talents
paul receives a url containing information about mr leonards past as a track star
he says they are introduced and are less of a threat than the government thinks
paul was very suprised that he didnt tell him
they are similar because they both only eat a very small range of foods they are specialists
crash coarse and little bits but a big deal
cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane
next the group should have carilified what kind of samples were needed in step
in order to replicate the experiment additional information is needed
i would need the amount of vinegar of r container
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they are both herbavors
the third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water
there fore it can survive in a variety of places
second you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers
pythons are different because there reptiles
they are both specialists aka animals with a selectiveexclusive diet
a certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins
the second section is explaining what the space just is
therefore light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse
white i chose white for the color of paint for the dog house
youd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used
plastic type b which stretched the longest could have had more weight on it than the others
the author organizes the article using an introduction two body sections and then a conclusion
one process used by cells is endocytosis
however pythons eat meat like other animals
rose seems very stressed but she handles it very well
plastic type b was the most strechably polymer
section one is the explaination of the story
he realizes that after all that mr leonard trained him to do he should help him in return
in the article it say pandas eat bamboo exclusively and koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
both pandas and koalas are specialist species
this is obvious because if the author didnt give you the what is space junk
a conclusion about this students data is plastic type b stretched the most
paul relates to him because he has the same difficulties as mr leonard
so paul says cmon mr leonard i said walking back toward school
as it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome
the author organizes the article by explaining in the introductory paragraph what the topic of the writing is
he organizes it by sections by different parts
the students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length
you would also need to know what four samples to use
white brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite
they also could have given the original lengths of each plastic
paul wants to repay mr leonards kindness by helping teach him as paul learns
diffusion is another way of transporting substances
osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane
white i would paint the dog house white
the author organizes the article by first introducing the problem at the beginning and then explaining the matter
exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cellion channels
paul is overwhelmed because mr leonard broke records and won the meter hurdles at the nationals
the author organizes the article by having an introduction that grabs the readers attention
paul knew exactly how mr leonard felt about not knowing how to read
she fell asleep while working on her essay
also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are
the information paul finds about mr leonard on the website is surprising to him
they both have only eats one type of food
though just a lowly hall monitor mr leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star
paul could have helped mrleonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling
if there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid
in addition they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure
they also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup
the author organizes the article by first explaining what the problem is
that not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics
also how much vinegar to put in the container
the mrna attaches to a ribosome to begin protein synthesis
i would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular
she did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt
a the polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type b because it stretched over mm
if i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp
they also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results
how much vinegar do i put into the containers
the author begins with an introduction that grabs the readers attention by making a shocking statement
the auther breaks up the article into subtopicssuch as what is space junk
all of the other plastics stretched less than this amount
these two species differ from a python because a python is a generalist
when paul asks what happened after that
by attracting more light it usually makes things much warmer
the additional information that should be included in this procedure is
i can conclude that plastic type b is the stretchiest because it stretched to and mm
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia because they both specialists
this shows that rose is a caring person
the introduction grabs the readers attention about the issue
the authors conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do
they could have repeated the experiment more to validate their results
you would also have to know where youre leaving these containers
they are different from pythons because pythons are generalists which means they can live many places
firstly in step one i would want to know specifically what the four different samples were
these substances move from high concentration to low concentration
he then learns mr leonard broke records at college nationals
throughout the story this confidence in paul helps motivate him to train and listen to mr leonard
how much vinegar how big a container
makes paul think that they are the same because they both cant read
mr leonard didnt have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading
basically it is a well organized informative essay
the results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar was increased or decreased
the author organizes this article by explaining different problems with orbiting space junk in each section
mr leonard saw an opportunity to help paul achieve his goals and he took that opportunity
this connection rises from the fact that they both struggle with reading
white the color white will affect the doghouse in a good way
so he decided he could help mrleonard out by training him
for example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same
as always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab
paul explains how he feels the same way now as mr leonard had in the past
a person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment
one trait that can identify rose is hopeful
the author organizes this article by like ideas
then it tells you how satellites crash in space
ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun
two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were
this means that they are spreading through the wildlife while simultaneously becoming a threat to biodiversity
then he begins explaining how it is a bad thing that it is there
one trait that can describe rose is that she is caring for others
pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia in the fact that they are both specialists
whereas for the others it stretched only mm and in type a it stretched mm
when paul finds out about all of this he wants to help mr leonard
when he is talking about space junk he labels that section what is space junk
after hearing mr leonards story paul made a mental connection with him
this shows that rose is a loving person and respects others
this will help because during the summer when it is hot it will keep the doghouse cooler
paul understood what mr leonard felt like
the students should be more specific in giving the directions well
this could help determine which plastics better
the author organizes this article into sectionsquestions for each topic
at the end paul says its time to start your trainingparagraph
through this connection they can both help each other out
pandas and koalas are very similar they both have a strict diet
the text describes a satellite crash that occured in february
a fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with
next trna moves in and adds the anticodon to start making a protein
you would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change
on the other hand a python can eat many different things and has many more options
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
crash course explains how an american and russian satellite crashed resulting in small pieces of debris
last i would need to where to store the samples for the hour period
describes what space junk is and how it negatively affects the environment
first the author grabs the readers attention by talking about a tool bag in the sky
lastly heshe explains why it is a big deal to many people why space junk is dangerous
the article is organized in a chronological way
when paul found out that mr leonard won the meter hurdles he was surprised
i can tell that plastic type a was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones
this tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information
the pandas eat bamboo from china the koala eat eucalyptus leaves
when she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care
she feels bad for the way she is feeling about her families situation right now
one trait of rose would be that she is hard working
and finally where do i pour the samples when filter and after the containers
the author does a great job explaining the way that the space junk works in outer space
this meaning that paul is trying to help mr leonard overcome his problems
plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic out of the reaching mm
after hearing mr leonards story he felt as though he should give back
rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful
the different sections the authour uses are orbiting junk as the introduction what is space junk
the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins
first the mrna leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it
at the end the author summarizes the article with a conclusion
although the groups results are not valid
one example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the us
rose is trying to be optimistic about the situation even though she does not feel it
how am i suppose to know what i am tasting if i dont know what the samples are
rose is very understanding of other people
this experiment is missing too much information
the second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mrna
the author starts his article with an attention grabber and briefly mentions space junk
the author organizes this atricle in different sections
the chinese panda and australian koalas are similar species
this is a quote taken out of the passage
they are much different than python reason being is that pythons will eat anything that is meat
things such as temperature are necessary
he wanted to show respect and help mr leonard do something too
she doesnt answer truthfully so they dont know how hard all of it is on her
the next two paragraphs explian what space junk is
this also tells us about the freeorbiting objests
in what is space junk it described what space junk actually is
the group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container
a based on the data plastic b was the most strethible plastic
the last peice of information paul learned about mr leonard was that he couldnt read
i say that type b plastic would work the best because it stretches more
paul now looks up to mr leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles
paul felt much sympathy for mr leonard and decided to help him read
koalas only eats eucalyptus leaves which grow natural in australia
the effect it has on paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion
when the reader gets the background information about mr leonard paul was surprised
rose is willing to work for her family and do anything for them
he was surprised he won meters at nationals and broke the records
plastic type a is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials
one way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials
the author organize the article by opening it with a brief introduction about space junk
is clearly going to talk about what space junk is
they are both different than pythons because pythons are generalists and they eat meat
mr leonard had flunked out of school and lost his scholarship
the last piece of information you need is what size container should you use
you would also need to know how long to rinse the samples
a cells membrane is selectively permeable
i n the lab the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed
rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family
they could have also add more trials to improve their design
osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell
the other plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic b
then he talks about how stuff like this is a big deal
the second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother
meanwhile there are pythons exploding because they try to eat alligators
so now paul trys harder in school and on the track
the author organizes the article by dividing the entire article into certain sections
second he or she talks about the satellites crashing
he should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate
based on roses conversations it is very obvious that she is a caring person
they also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left right or anything
you would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup
he or she also uses subtitles such as crash course to explain a few extraterrestrial crashes
the author first starts off with an interesting introduction by providing rhetorical statements like its a
the author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line
paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he cant read
no matter how small the junk may be it can still cause damage
he connects with him and feels sorry for him
it also emphasizes the growing number of satellites capsules telescopes etc
mr leonard had reading problems when he was around pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports
first the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article
she doesnt want to tell the truth and then hurt her aunts feelings so she remains quiet
she works all the time just to help her brother
paul finds out that mr leonard was a great track star
that proves she cares for her family and is a kind and caring person it decribes her
i also need to know how much vinegar in each of the cups
conclusion there was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic
they are different because they are both not specialist
this setup provides background information for the readers to clarify the theme
rose ignores the question because she doesnt want to hurt her family
finally they need to say at what temperature they should sit room temp
mr leonard was great at hurdles and so is paul
the space junk is created from satellites colliding into each other and creating debris
the author then supports the subtopics by details put in two to four paragraphs
he met a school coach began hurdling on mr leonards track
white is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar
therefore paul was effected by mrleonard background
the black lid was average degc it got hotter because the color was darker
they are both similar because they both only eat one thing
next they talk about the damage space junk can do
a transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain
after this actual examples of space junk are given
paul wasnt aware of this and asked why
the author breaks down the article into three different sections
unlike the python which they dont have a problem with migrating and adapting in other environments
the data provided concludes that plastic type b stretched the most
a the plastic b has the most amount that stretched
finally i would also need to know what type of equipment i would use to measure the mass
the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with peptide bonds
these small pieces can cause damage because of the rate of speed that they are moving
black painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer
she doesnt want to hurt others around her so she keeps many of her feelings inside
also changing the environment could improve the experiment
in the conclusion of the experiment plastic type b stretched the most to mm to mm
we would also need to know what kind of container they used
paul had no idea that his new coach was even a runner
the four major steps are that the mrna leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein
by telling the length of the plastic in the beginning we could see the change that occured
this suggest that she is wanting to take care of anna
another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk
the auther defines the problem giving an examples of space junk
he then tells people about the satellites and what happens to them
it holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky
this shows that the white lid was deg degrees color on average than the black lid
you would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses
in the text rose is worried about hurting her mother or her aunt
the story states this man had given his time to help me excel at something
at the end of the story paul wants to help mr leonard out by helping him read
second it doesnt state what are the samples like what rocks they are
this could effect the mass of the object at the end
the information effected paul because mr leonard is a great athlete
based on the students data i can conclude that plastic b is more flexible
paul is motivated by mr leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports
both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read
white if the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder
this differs from the python because unlike pandas koalas pythons are carnivores
paul feels a connection to mr leonard he states that in paragraph sentence
the trna keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain
pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
chinas panda and australias koala bear are similar because they really dont each much
and what kind of container casinial use
paul would pay for rose and anna to go to college so that they can get jobs
you would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same
paul was shocked to find out that mr leonard was a hurdler in college
we have our part to do to help paul finish college
through these ideas rose realizes how important family is
in the story rose supports this claim by thinking
the experiment can also describe the materials since the word materials can mean almost anything
during trial white was deg while black was deg
they invaded the area and altered the natural balance of it
active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy
facilitated diffusion is diffusion only with large molecules
the jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar
oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse
she finds what to write about in this speaking with aunt kolab
hey my friend where do you think your going
paul found out that mr leonard was a very good hurdler
three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion osmosis and endocytosis
mrleonard had trouble reading and end up losing his scholarship and flunked out of college
how much water do you rinse them with and for how long
you can tell from the story that rose is a considerate person
the background information that paul gets about mr leonard was familiar
human and equipment errors as always possible
based on the data plastic type b stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least
lastly he tells us that little bits of space junk can have a big impact on spacecraft
it doesnt say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that
so durin g the summer the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house
you would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors
also the article said that a python can live anywhere as a pandakoala cant
invasive species refer to animalsspecies that was introduced to an area it did originally live in
in the introduction the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements
the coach gives paul a website to go to
in space even tiny particles will cause some major damage
the author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs
the student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times
the next section the author writes is what is space junk
the author then describes why there is space junk
lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution
the additional information i would need to complete this experiment is this
another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp
one trait described in the story from rose talking to anna is caring
paul understands how he feels and decides to help mrleonard to read better since he helped him so much
the student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested
also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used
even if it is just a small thing floating around it could cause alot of harm
the word invaisive is significant to this article
mr leonard had trouble with reading but at his school they didnt have a learning center
pual felt some sort of empathy because he knows what its like not being able to read well
osmosis is when water is passing through the cell
the conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration
by having all the masss the same it would be easier to determine the difference
paul states you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
as the trna attaches to the mrna the amino acids above them form peptide bonds
active transport is the opposite of diffusion
also the plastic type d is the only plastic that had the same length of mm for both trials
this is shown in her conversation with both her sister anna and aunt kolab
step but they dont tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf
australias koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively
paul discovers that mr leonard had once ran track at a college level
roses conversations with her aunt kolab shows that she is a caring person
the author organizest the article very well
after realizing mr leonards story paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him
also the measure of the weights werent specified
diffusion doesnt use energy to move substances
explains how disabled satellites can become junk orbiting the earth
he ws shocked at first because he didnt think that mrleonard couldve ben a track star
endocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to transport large substances into the cell
in order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure
the author organizes the article by putting it in headings
seeing her like that made her worried about her and asked what was wrong and if she felt alright
the highschool trach coach handed paul a url for the internet to visit
in the article the word invasive signifies was against the introduction of reptiles
what kind of vinegar you usewhat kind of containers you should use
by doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one
so i know what everything what everything is so i can create a data table
determine what type of containers are being used
italso means itchanges the enviornmental chain
a python is a generalist it has a wide habitat range and can eat many different things
all these things are essential to replicating this experiment
this will continue until it reaches a stop codon
this monitors the substances that go through the semipermeable membrane
no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
arguably this animal can live anywhere and can eat a variety of things
finally he explains the importance of space trash and finding a solution to the problem
for example plastic a only stretched mm for trials
then finally where should i let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out
i would need to know how long to wash with water for
if she told her aunt the truth she would hurt her aunt
i would say a good trait to describe rose would be that she is very caring
a repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results
they both cant read but both are good at track
a plastic type b is the stretchiest based on their data
paul knew the emotions in mrleonards words they were all to familiar to paul
the author then gives an explanation for what he or she is writing about
i would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container
mr leonards background information greatly influences paul
the way she talks to her sister anna lets you see she cares about her
another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic
type d stretched mm while type c stretched mm
black white would keep the doghouse the coldest ar ound
then white would be too cold at an aver age temp at degrees
also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid
the author begins his article with an attentiongrabbing introduction with the shocking exclamations
a in conclusion plastic type b could stretch the most
this procedure also should specify what materials to use line what brand of cups or size
white the best paint color for the doghouse is white
the background information of mr leonard effects paul in a positive way
the student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting mm
first we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers enough to cover them
if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
i have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place
finally the group did not say the size of the container
so paul understood how mr leonard felt he felt embarresed
mrlenorad lets paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read
the phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane
the conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest
paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either
white was on averge deg c cooler than black
the author did a really good job of writing this article
the least stretchy would be plastic type a
when paul finds out that mr leonard was a runner also he is very surprised
the author uses titles that break the article down into smaller categories to organize the text
then the trna undergoes translation with amino acids
i knew them wellfeelings of embarrassement
the information that paul gets is really familiar to him
the author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention
also in step the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut
the sections also make the article easier to navigate and read
in the way they are different to pythons
if we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results
lastly you would need to know how much distilled water that you need
in paragraph if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt
one trait that describe rose is that she is a hard worker
this is what makes them different from pythons because pythons are generalist species
a conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type a is the strongest
it is all under the main topic orbiting junk
passive transport where the need niether energy or a key
after paul found out that mr leonard had to drop out of college
it shows paul that being good at a sport isnt everything
how much vinegar should be poured into the containers
a i can conclude that this experiment was not valid
the amount that plastic type a stretched was mm on the first trial and mm on the second trial
osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane
in addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well
the second section explains what space junk is and how it got there
osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane
he found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle he still have to study very hard
each trna anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rrna
another piece of information i would need is how much vinegar do i use for each sample
second the procedure did not specify how big each samples should be
another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat
paul could very much relate to mr leonards words
the white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool
black black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most
plastic types and c were stiffer while types b and d stretched more
shes caring towards her family memebers
she asked this to anna even though rose herself wasnt well
other pairs of the word were they used to leaves live
when paul finds out that mr leonard can not read he wants to help him
he had felt like he had something in common with mr leonard
becaue in the results the average for light grey was degand that in perfect tempature
the first was space junk that described what space junk is and how it came about
the background information of mr leonard encourages paul to help the hall monitor out
and they could have tested more types of plastics
to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about
black if you painted the dog house black the insid e would be hot
also it is not know how moch vinegar to use for each substance
one piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure
the effect the background information about mr leonard had on paul was inspiring
he describes how satellites have a risk of colliding since there is no one controlling them
also the student could have named the type of plastics
mr leonard answered i was a good runner but wasnt a really good student
also it would be necessary to know what i should weigh the samples on
diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane
they could of also explained how plastic types become smaller
white i think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house
active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient
it would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in
a plastic b stretched more than plastics ac d when weights are added to it
mr leonard doesnt know how to read and is helping paul with hurdles
you cant do an experiment if you dont know what youre testing on
now he realizes he isnt alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident
how many items of material were put into each container
heshe then adresses the problem about space junk
plastic type b stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight
i would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container
to replicate this i need to know what samples im working with
each section is wsell informed and organized
he got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run
the author explained how pandas in china eats almost nothing but bamboo which means that he is harmful
the panda and koala are different from a python because they are specialists and a python is a generalist
in order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps
she is taking a job that conflicts with her school work jsut to help put paul through college
learning mr leonards background information paul becomes more interested in his life
mr leonard didnt have help with his grades
you will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at
for example the author uses uses the subtitle what is space junk
for example how much vinegar should be poured into each container
those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other
to improve this lab they could have made one more trial averaged the results
the group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample
the author organized the article by separating information into several different sections
she shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and anna
learning mr leonards background information helped paul be even more determined to succeed
black the black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house
paul knows that mr leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too
i think the background information of mr leonard inspired paul
also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched
rose also understands that she needs to keep her job
it had the most streching for both the first and second trial mm and mm
i would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get
after that they tell why space junk is harmful and dangerous
there the pythons reproduce and their population ie harming five endangered species in tile area
endocytosis in this process a cell brings in molecules or substances which requres energy
explains space exploration and how manmade objects are in space orbit
a based on this data the students can conclude that plastic b is the stretchiest sample
polymer b has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested
paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read
with plastic c the results decreased by one mm
also must have had the same amount of weights applied
diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration
during the story the reader gets information about mr leonards track records
you would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment
the experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure
they eat only one thing pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves
first i would need to know what they used to determine the mass
the students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used
he even says the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar
the amount of vinegar stated in procedure z
there is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure
we would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment
the trait that rose has is responsability
paul could relate to mr leonards emotions because he too had difficulties wtih school work
another piece of information i would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup
and the black wouldnt be a good color because darker colors absorb more energy
he first starts out with an introduction
for plastic type a the amount stretched increased by one mm
substances enter the cell through carrier proteins
white a white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside
this will make the procedure easier to follow
plastic type is stretches the most in both trials
also it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar
in the passage rose says we have our part to do to help paul finish college
these sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read
then the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space
also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each
lastly you need to know what temperature to store them at
plastic type a b both stretched a little more in trial and plastic type c stretched less
from the students data you can tell that plastic type a has the best stretchability
the paragraph titled what is space junk
one prcess is the use of the semipermeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell
and how much vinegar the students poured into each container
a semipermable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in
invasive species like the python in the everglades are beginning to threat native species
molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
and lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark
he ended up losing his scholarship and flunking out of college
you would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers
when mr leonard told paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship
the introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern
when paul learns of mr leonards background he instantly begins to look up to him
i would need to know what the samples were in the procedure
he wanted to help mr leonard since he helped him
this man had given his time to help me excel at somethng
you would also need to know what the materials are that youre putting into containers
in order to run this experiment i would need to know what samples are being tested
paul even statesthe emotion in mrleonards words were all to familiar to me
another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long
paul finds out that mr leonard was an old track runner and that he broke many records
it helps paul know that he isnt the only one with this problem
according to the data table plastic type b is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping
plastic type b stretched mm then mm the second time
the author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk
chinas panda australias koala are similar as they are both considered as specialists
at first paul just sees mr leonard as the hall monitor in his school
the students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length
in protein sythesis the mrna travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm
so that is the additional information i would need to complete this experiment
when all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework
the background information about mr leonard has a good effect on paul
you would also need to know what type of materials you need
it does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass
than the author gives his thesis statment
in order to replicate the experiment the group of students need a control
the data indicates them but the procedure does not
the author first talks about what is the earths autmosphere can handle and what we may see out there
the author organizes the article by using interesting facts to grab the readers attention
they should have been more specific about their mass g of the weights used
white it will keep the dog cooler in the summer
and what will you use to determine the mass of the samples
no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read
plastic b stretched mm and mm which was the largest length after five minutes
the background information we learn about mr leonard is a huge twist on the story
how pandas in china are similar to koalas in australia is that they are both bears that eat plants
a plastic b is the most flexible of the plastic types
he asks mr leonard what happened and he acts concerned about it
this means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot
first the author gives an introduction informing the readers what the article will be about
rose said we have our part to help paul finish college
the background information paul learned form mrleonard made a diffrence
these include passiveactive transport facilitated diffusion and osmosis
people do not realize what harm it could have
rose does not answer this question because she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings
this procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly
paul soon found out that mr leonard was just like him and paul wanted to achieve for mr leonard
based on the data plastic type b stretched the most out of all of the plastics
truly good experiment has at least trials
not just leaving it out of their processes
secondly the amount of each substance should be the same
last they have little bits but a big deal
in this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type b stretched the most in both trials
they should have specified the mass of the weights used
after that they tell you about the crash course
in conclusion plastic type b has the highest stretchability while type a has the lowest
for example plastic b is much more stretchy then plastic a
the ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem
the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
most of the plastics ended up stretching mm
it also gives light to possible solutions
the python would try to eat anything that it thinks its able to to eat
she keeps working towards a better future for her family and herself
that the containers were stored at for hours
the first section explains the main purpose of the aticle
this is what she tries to portray to anna
and state how much weight is being added to the plastic
this would encourage paul to try hard to learn to read
it also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free
the author organizes this article into diffrent categories
the word invasive helps to create a debate in the article
they did not say what to do with the container when you finish
the statement that supports my answer would be rose didnt answer
he could identify with the embarrassment he felt
he seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name
what is space junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place
the student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length
a plastic sample b was the stretchiest because its greatest length was mm
active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy
it shows that rose a mature and understanding person partly because she feels obligated to
plastic b stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity stretchability
facilitated diffusion the passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy working against the gradient
others believe they are invading places like florida were they shouldnt be
the author organizes the article by using the classic topical structure
generalists like change and can live almost everywhere
the background information gives paul a sense of connection with mr leonard
another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container
they are able to survive in different climates to adapt to places in different regions
he believes that paul can do domething great
pythons are the opposite of pandas and koalas because they are generalist
the following section explains collisions involving space debris
their are three things wrong with this procedure
there are many things she wants for herself in life
more information would be needed to replicate the experiment
he finds that mr leonard used to be on the track team when he was in college
rose is considerate of other peoples feelings
a based upon the data plastic b was the most flexable while plastic a was the least flexable
but to improve this experiment i would do more trials to make it more accurate
one way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials
they are similar because they are both animals
in order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information
crash course and little bits but a big deal
for when its hot it would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black
also what size container should be used
paul said you were a college freshman who won the meter hurdles at the nationals
he started with what is space junk whick explains what hes talking about
on the first trial plastic type b stretched mm while plastic c only stretched mm
how much vinegar is needed in the containers
this information encouraged paul to strive in learning to read
the second trial all plastics stretched further except for type c and d which did not change
he breaks it down into different topics
i also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment
white the paint color that they should use is white
then the next section explains what space junk is
it also motivates him to help mr leonard
in what is space junk the author tells us what space junk is
then they going on to explain what the topic of space junk is
also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results
a third piece of information needed would be what samples to use
mr leonard wanted paul to be like him in a way just be better
then in the next two sections he goes into greater detail about how its a problem
the author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first
thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot
plastic type b stretched the longest of them all with mmfor its first trial and mmfor the second trial
then he continues and talk about the section crash crouse
after that came a plastic d with mm followed by plastic c at mm
passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell
i relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard
the author brings in some history which is needed to explain a few things
the author organizes the article by suptitles going from the most improtnant to the least
the students can add more more time for the weights to hang
also they could have used a control for comparison
next he then explain his next section little bits but a big deal
paul asked him why didnt you tell me about this
the mrna feeds the code through the rrna
they dont say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples
paul is happy an shocked at the same time
in the article called crash course it describes two satelite crashes that happened in and
each of these titles informs you about what your going to be reading about in the pargraph below
this is a positive view that an optomistic person would have
as a result pythons and other generalist species thrive in this day and age
just like with the jar l id when it was black it absorbed the most
one trait that describes rose is caring
paul states the emotions in mr leonards words were all too familiar to me
he wanted to help mr lenard like mr lenard helped him
