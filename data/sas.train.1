The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic .
He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read .
When speaking to Rose , she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation .
Thus , the word invasive demonstrates a central conflict in the article . ''
The author organized the article by having an introduction and putting the information into different catagories .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
It also explains why it is a problem and how the problem is being fixed .
Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest .
Another way that it could 've been improved was to do more trials .
He does this to emphasize the seriousness of space junk .
Panda 's and koalas are similar because they do n't have a wide range of food choice .
Chinese pandas and Australian koala bears are similar because they 're both specialists .
In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius .
The trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be helpful .
helps us understand the overall idea and explains the material in the article .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' is used to describe the reptile species being invaded into America .
She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is .
Based on Rose 's conversations , it is very obvious that she is a caring person .
The first one , entitled 'What is Space Junk ? '
Rose is very respectful and conconcious about other 's feelings .
After being told this , Paul feels simpathy for him because he too can not read .
For example , the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard .
Based on what three bases you have in each segment , a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid .
What do they measure length in .
The author organizes the story with easy to navigate subtitles .
To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
Type B has the most stretchability .
the light gray was average 45 ( DEG ) C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter .
In order to replicate this experiment , additional information is needed .
This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng .
`` The group stated to `` '' determine the mass of four different samples .
This touches Paul because he can not read either .
Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average .
^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried their sample .
Active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain .
The author begins with 'Orbiting Junk ' to describe the clutter of 'space junk ' in our orbit .
On the website he sees someone he has grown close to .
The author organize the article by opening it with a brief introduction about 'space junk ' .
You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions .
Which this has already happened in 2009 .
Paul was shock to find out the Mr.Leonard broke records back in his college years .
tool bag ? '
Also , it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard .
I would also need to know what temperature .
There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure .
That is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell .
What type of vinegar it is should also be included .
Lastly , he or she talks about small issues that are a big deal .
At the end , Paul says , 'It 's time to start your training ' ( paragraph 46 ) .
He also was bad at reading just like Paul .
Meaning that Paul was going to teach him a little bit .
In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding .
By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment .
^p B ) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure .
b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct .
They also say to let it sit for 24 hours , where should it sit ?
It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used .
So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it .
The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain .
They both only eat one thing , pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus .
It really depends on where t he people live and on the season .
Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons .
That makes it a possible invasive species .
Paul has help , from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard .
However , there are ways in which this experiment could be improved .
Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to excel in tack , and Paul will teach him how to read better .
It 's a comet !
In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information .
It 's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters .
Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container .
If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm .
Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college .
2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem . '
^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one .
Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability .
Paul understands Mr. Leonard and since Mr. Leonard helped him , he is going to help Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes this article by like ideas .
The words `` '' A sample '' '' does n't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed .
They are specialists ; pandas only eat bamboo and koalas just eat eucalyptus leaves .
He then use the next sectoin , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
It also determines Paul to do better in school and track .
He understands why Mr. Leonard has been helping him .
It never states what materials to use .
Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read .
The section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris .
It could hold the most weight , without stretching .
This will make the procedure easier to follow .
Pual had a reading problum which caused him to do poorly in school .
First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass .
One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container .
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup .
The author first starts off with an interesting introduction by providing rhetorical statements like 'It 's a .
The student 's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching .
The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be .
He then learns Mr. Leonard broke records at college nationals .
Next , the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother .
Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four .
What type of containers will be needed .
The author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things .
3. containers size .
white : : brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers .
Since there as the of materials
Before learning of Mr. Leonard 's background , Paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read .
A ribosome attaches to the mRNA ( rRNA ) .
Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard had been a track star .
They are both specialists , AKA animals with a selective/exclusive diet .
This shows that the white lid was 11 ( DEG ) degrees color on average than the black lid .
Pythons on the other hand are carnivores and will eat almost anything moving .
Under 'Crash Course ' the author explains how sattelites colide into eachother .
The author uses the introduction to grab the readers attention .
This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy .
2 ) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table .
The author starts with stating the serious yet shocking facts of the article .
Also , plastic type A stretched the least , only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm .
It also gives Paul inspiration .
In paragraph 19 , the author writes , 'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
The next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other .
He knew how it felt not to read .
white : : The paint color that they should use is white .
Thus piece of info is crucial . ''
This makes for a well rounded article .
the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar .
The introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article .
You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability .
The author follows with a description as to what happens after satellites become space junk .
He talks about the different types of space junk in the section .
The author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories .
The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B .
Based on the students data , the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability .
However , snakes are becoming overly popular .
They area both different from pythons , generalist species , who can eat a lot of different animals .
They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap .
He still should finish his college and get his scholarship .
This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same .
The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2 .
Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought .
Paragraphs six and seven tell you how dangerous space junk really is .
They are helping each other with the things that are holding them back .
How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for ?
I would also need to be able to know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample .
How much vinegar would you pour in each cup .
Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems .
So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house .
In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well .
that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow .
He seperated it into three diffrent sections so you knew what you were reading about .
Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights .
Paul really wants to try now to read and teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable , stretching an average of 11mm .
Secondly , there should be a precise amount of weights being added .
When her little sister Anna says , ' I 'm so lonesome for Papa .
This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers .
Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away .
The author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come .
This is because white does n't attract as much heat .
Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat .
They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant .
so inside this doghouse when black , it can get hot .
^p b ) 1 ) Made all the types start out in the same length .
This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane .
If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment .
Two , you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container .
The author starts off with a piece of space junk in the air .
If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment .
After this they tell you about how two satellites crashed into one another causing space debris .
Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well .
The way Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes Paul a little emotional .
This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment .
Paul knew that Mr. Leonard was probably embrassed because he could n't read and Paul knew how it felt .
The author organizes the article with different sections all explaining different points .
The most stretchable would be plastic B .
' , the author explains how the engines used to power spaceships are disintegrated .
So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another .
That also could effect the difference of the mass 's .
Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings .
So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter .
In the story , Rose is hopeful .
So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
She is hopeful .
You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container .
Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
if they used the white the dog house would be too cold .
The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used .
the effect that Paul gets when he gets the backround information on Mr. Leonard was shcok and disbelief .
And how much vinegar the students poured into each container .
Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat .
It shows that she is caring
The container 's reapetedly , separate but identicle conatainer .
What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying .
Paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read .
During the story , the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
We would also need to know what kind of container they used .
Well , first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting .
Another thing the students forgot was the different samples , what are they ?
Nonative animals invade a land and sort of offset the balance of nuture in that area .
Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists .
Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well .
Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample .
a . )
But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate .
Also , it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label .
China 's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo .
Knowing this , Paul is now motivated to take his grades seriously .
In sections within the body he turns his tone into a more serious one .
passive transport- doesnt require energyactive transport-requires energy
She cares so much for the other people in her life that she is willing to suffer .
And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment .
Rose is very respectfull of her elders .
^p c Would need to know what materials to gather .
She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college .
Earth is not used to the rapid change humans have brought that lives complicated an environments niche .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read .
I lost my scholarship and flunked out .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' can be looked at in two ways in the article .
No other school wanted a runner who could n't read .
He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
The pandas in China and koalas of Australia are similar because they are both specialists .
This man had given me his time to help me excel at something .
Plastic B can stretch the most .
Thirdly , the author transitions into talking about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other .
^p 1 .
This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar .
Paul was concerned about why Mr. Leonard never told him about this .
There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
Because the temperature and sunlight 's does changes the result .
( We did n't know the weight of them ) .
It was n't as strong as it should of been on the second trial .
This was something that Paul could relate to .
Next he gets right into explaining exactly what the article is about .
Unspokingly Mr. Leonard has gone through the same trouble that Paul is currently facing .
This is when the cell does not require energy to move .
First he starts out by getting the readers attention by personal experiance .
`` In the article , `` '' invasive '' '' is perceived by people as having two different meanings .
Specify the size of the container in step 2 .
You would need the size of the container , amount of vinegar used , the types of samples .
^p Initial amount for each samples . ''
Paul would pay for Rose and Anna to go to college so that they can get jobs .
They are moving northward and hold a potential threats to more northern ecosystem an could cause problems .
He stars with an interdoction to get you intersetes in space .
Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch .
They are similar because they are both animals .
The authors organization of the paper is into clearly labeled , pertinant sections .
He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete .
Look up in the sky !
Lastly , I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with .
These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment .
How much of such sample should be used .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares for the well being of others .
I think the students should have started out with the same mass .
Then , the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space .
They are both different than pythons because pythons are generalists , 'What generalists favor is change . '' ''
They live where they do because that is where they can survive .
Pythons however can adapt and find food , and are therefore generalists .
a ) In conclusion , the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B .
This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center .
^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at .
Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides .
Which is debrie from satelittes and tools .
To the different samples were listed in the procedure , it would be betterunderstand .
Inside , outside , by a window ?
The author starts out with a good , exciting introduction .
An example of this is the panda eating nothing but bamboo .
Let done specify which suitably materials were used : Marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
First , I would need to the materials needed for the lab .
Paul was n't aware of this and asked why .
Line 4 : 'In 1957 , the Soviet Union launched th efirst artificial satellite .
) The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment .
The author organizes the article by making the first body parragraph 'What Is Space Junk ? '
a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm .
As long as the climate is right , they can adjust and find food .
As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels .
Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds .
1.A list of materials and safety requirements .
The next section is titled 'Crash Course ' .
1 .
^p b .
Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water .
Therefore we could see how much it 's stretched .
The author organizes the article by catching your attention with shocking statements made in the introduction .
A trait that Rose shows in her conversation with Aunt Koleb is caring .
After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials , they also need a control .
^p + Efficiency ; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions .
Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid .
white : : Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun .
After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code .
In order to replicate this experiment , I would need to know many details .
Instead of seeing some meteor or comet , the author sees a toolbag in space .
In order to replicate the lab , the students did you would need to know what materials were need .
Mr. Leonard was a track star ut he could not read .
' , 'Crash Cource ' , and 'Little Bits , Bit a Big Deal . '
The anticodon is bonded to the codon.4 .
B ) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial .
To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information .
Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard .
The third step , the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis .
Then , tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA .
The author explained how panda 's in China eats almost nothing but bamboo which means that he is harmful .
^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial .
It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star .
I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad .
The author puts 'What is Space Junk ? '
Mr. Leonard is likely trying to work out his own shortcommings by making Paul a good student and athlete .
The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial .
Rose is very gentle .
Both animals are different from a python , who eats a variety of other living creatures .
One characteristic that can adequately define Rose 's personality would be hard-working .
^p b .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is both a track star and a poor reader .
Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing .
Also , a control group could be added .
has all the information about how space junk has gotten into our atmosphere and what it is .
The background information makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard because he feels the same way .
Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break .
Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard did not know his name .
Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in .
Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it 's own force while the clamps wont .
a . )
Koalas eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively and they are different from pythons because .
What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist animals .
black : : Black absorbs light .
how would also need to know if they used the same size cup .
That is when he found hurdles .
A .
The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections .
The next process is passive transport .
Then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life .
Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read .
How much vinegar was put into every cup .
And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better .
They both can only eat one type of food .
The author explains how invasive species `` '' are major threat to biodiversity '' '' .
Active transport , on the other hand , is a process of movement which does require energy .
I believe that it had a motivational effect on him .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are born specialists .
Pythons can barley survive in cooler climates , where they live should be warm .
Paul responds by feeling more of a connection to Mr. Leonard .
Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret .
When Paul finds out about the background information on Mr. Leonard he is shocked .
The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump .
Paul is very shocked by what he see 's on the internet about Mr. Leonard .
( ie grams , pounds , ouples )
Also , around how much of the samples do you need ?
Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also could n't read .
and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees .
First man to make it into college without knowing how to read , that should be a great accomplishment .
You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with .
In order to replicate the experiment , there is some information that was n't involved that is needed .
Then the author gives some background information about what space junk really is .
Rose said , 'Only if you already have everything . '
this help him to practice runnung and he help Mr.Leonard to practice reading .
Also , what is the size of the containers ?
As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out .
Based on the student 's data .
How much vinegar is needed in each dish .
They did not say what to do with the container when you finish .
In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way .
^p b .
As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
^p b ) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used .
Osmosis- The process by which water is moved from a high leel of concentration to a low one .
An example would be the python in the Everglades .
Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data .
The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes .
a : Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics .
And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski ' could n't read that good himself so they had something in common .
These students could have improved in a lot of things .
Paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school .
Anna is very caring about other people 's feelings .
How the author organizes the article is he puts different information into a different catergory .
( tongs )
This shows how serious the problem is .
Diffusion does n't use energy to move substances .
Then also finds out that he flunked out because he could n't read .
For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same .
What the out come is .
It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through .
What is the sample material .
As the article said , they eat only one kind of food , and live in only one place .
Pandas in China are both similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
^P Add another type of plastic .
Paul discovers some information about Mr. Leonard when he is given the URL for the track and field website .
That Rose is a thoughtful girl because she would n't tell her aunt something that would hurt her .
No matter how small the space junk is , it is dangerous .
Mr. Leonard lost his scholarship and dropped out of college because he could not read .
^P B .
So it just showed Paul that he should n't give up just because something gets hard in life .
This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable .
first for explaining the variety of things we are putting in the atmosphere .
After reading the groups , I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment .
Plastic type A was the stretchiest .
It 's a meteor !
Based on the students data , plastic type B had more stretchability than the others .
Her family needs money and their papa 's new job paid three times the salary of his last job .
'Little bits , but a Big Deal ' is informing us about those articles combined kind of .
All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem .
You feel okay ? '
If she otld the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
The student could have done more trials .
a . )
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane .
Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard 's past and is surprised .
describes what it is they are talking about and informing the reader .
It stretched between 22-23mm .
The panda and koala are similar because they are both specialists .
This shows that she did not want to hurt the family .
It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics .
It doesnt really effect the back ground so much
Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2 .
This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal .
It also show how people can help other people .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
Here , they explain that when satellites malfunction , they become high-tech junk .
^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group .
Learning about Mr. Leonard 's background information gives Paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer .
Paul understands that feeling of embarrassment .
He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles .
In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers .
^P 2 .
From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly .
The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA .
Cells can use Passive Transports , which is where there is no energy used.2 .
One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic .
It should also tell the size , and or type of containers used in this experiment .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past he is interested and wants to know more .
Rose is help ful because she help around the house and help Paul finish college .
One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure .
The author divided this article into sections .
This requires energy .
The author starts with a shocking hook , which draws the reader in .
The next two sections are about how Space Junk is made and what it can cause .
Pandas and koalas also are confined to one part of the world , while pythons are now in many .
First , the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers .
Mr.Leonard backround information affects Paul because it show paul if you work hard you can reach you goals .
Is there only reducing to ism the `` '' sample . '' ''
Pandas and koalas are both specialists because they can survive in very specific habitats .
Mayber her life would get easier . '
You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured .
Then they going on to explain what the topic of space junk is .
From the very beggining the author starts the sentence with a catchy and exciting lead .
Biologists , however feel invasive species are major threats to biodiversity .
Next , we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material .
In the article it says , `` '' A python swallowed an alligator ... '' '' .
and there are two paragraphs in that section .
We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did .
Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight .
First , the amount of vinegar would be needed .
Mr. Leonard responce was ' I was a good Athlete , but not a good student .
The author organizes this atricle in 4 different sections .
This shows the reader that tiny space fragments are a big deal and could really hurt somebody .
I think that this is a very organized article .
The subtitle 'Crash Course ' provides a specific example of space debris being created .
so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog .
Also having the same measurement size for each plastic .
^p ( 3 ) How much of each sample to use .
In the second section , Crash Course , the author tells you about the risks of the dead satellites .
The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched .
It 's a meteor !
Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star .
Next , tRNA comes along and attaches it 's anti-codons to the mRNA 's codons .
One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working .
But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability .
He flunked out of college because is his disablilty to read .
With the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop .
This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him this .
) , and how long to rinse for .
I need to kind the control group indipendant variable , dependant variable , control variable .
The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same .
Another process is diffusion .
Two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching .
How much vinegar do I put into the containers ?
Pandas and koala 's , however , can not .
light gray : : The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm .
The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest .
Paul offters to train him and help him read .
In ( T1 ) it stretched 10mm , and in ( T2 ) it stretched 12mm.^p b . )
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star , Paul becomes more motivated .
the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color .
First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent .
It 's a meteor !
Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red .
Rose is a helpful , kind loving sister .
One trait that Rose is hopeful .
Another is How much water to use when rinsing it .
If these three were added to the procedure , then you could replicate the experiment .
They require a very specific habitat to live .
All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first .
^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in .
Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2 .
This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point .
They also talked about there grandpa moving away and how its been hard on them both .
As time went on , he failed out .
China 's panda eats nothing but bamboo , Australia 's koala bear that eats eucalyptus .
I can also see that type A streched the least amount .
The author also lists details of conflicts with satellites , and crashes that have occured in the past .
Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
Pandas and koala bears both live in warm climates where the plants they eat , grow .
Pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves .
But experiment D have the same type of stretching .
Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there .
I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular .
The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time .
This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy .
They differ from pythons because a python is a generalist , who can live anywhere .
After reading this experiment there is a lot I 'd need to know .
Paul now realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the fact that they both have trouble reading .
and black averged 53.25 ( DEG ) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white .
Mr. Leonard said , ' I looked good back then , did n't I ? '
After that , the author explains three different problems that space junk creates .
The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling .
A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant .
Pandas and Koalas are both specialists .
The backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind .
a .
Both the pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are very similar .
Paul then deliberates that because Leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read .
While Paul is gon na help Mr. Leonard read .
If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool , they should use white paint .
white : : white will , attract less heat .
Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ?
a ) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability .
This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it .
After that he explains what space junk is and where it comes from .
These two animals require certain factors in their habitat .
mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis .
Also must have had the same amount of weights applied .
Rose is a positive person .
white : : white reflect the light .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here ' .
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
The author started off by telling us what space junk is , then went into the different catergories .
It should also tell you to do repeated trials .
In fact , he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard 's accomplishment and showed it to him .
Such as colliding satellites .
Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material .
The author organizes the article by starting off with a very clear introduction that captures the reader 's attention .
In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain , you need additional information .
At the part of the story when Mr. Leonard states 'We had no learning centers in our school . '
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
However , once introduced here , they can survive and thrive in the southern U.S .
white : : the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside .
The coach gives Paul a website to go to .
Also , by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes , but also 10 minutes .
They are both different than pythons because pythons are generalists and they eat meat .
They also should have used the same amount of each plastic .
You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers .
Rosa tries not to upset others .
1 .
Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes .
The invasive species invade and are n't imbalance in ecosystems .
He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read .
The article states that both animals eat a certain food present only in their native environment .
These little pieces flying around this fast can destroy a satellite .
In the way they are different to pythons .
Finally , the procedure does not include a control .
First he has the introduction part of the article .
If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp .
The titles of the section and article , 'Orbiting Junk ' , 'What IS Space Junk ?
They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights .
^p B .
Make sure the plastics were all the same length .
explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth .
So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing .
The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as , 'Grab your telescope !
After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments , Paul thought of an idea .
Both animals eat plants .
The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul .
Biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an unfamiliar environment .
It 's time to start your training . '
Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts .
He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed .
How Space junk is formed and what happens to the debris in space .
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles .
She is so worried about helping her brother go to college .
A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid .
Osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell .
Mr. Leonard did n't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading .
The story states , 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
He also tells how it is not just something small in space that cant cause damage .
I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment .
Rose is very caring .
Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D , C , A .
dark gray : : I would use dark gray .
Plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials .
Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog , and therefore making white the right color .
According to the experiment , the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B .
You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample .
Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers .
Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects .
He feels as if all the help Leonard has given , he should return some of it .
'What is Space Junk ? '
The effect the background information has on Paul is that Paul realizes he can help Mr. Leonard .
Plastic D is the least stretchy .
Second you will need to know the temperature of the room .
Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use , and which materials .
We do n't know the original lengths of plastic .
The first catagory 'What is space junk ? '
'What 's wrong ?
They move on to what really is 'space junk ' .
Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell .
Rose is understanding while having a conversation with Anna .
The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times .
They are both different from pythons because seem toeat meat substances .
a ) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least .
Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in his running days .
Paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he ca n't read .
These non-native species are dangerous because they often have no natural predators in the new environment and they flourish .
But her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter . '
You feel okay ? '
Paul realizes this and connects them with a bond .
Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing .
The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk , then providing the dangers of it .
All the other sections follow a similar suit .
white : : White could be a color for the doghouse .
Even though this is just vinegar , their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab .
Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is , 1 .
She fakes a laugh , and pretends everything is okay , even when it is not .
Because Paul discovers this , he feels a drive .
They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container .
`` The entire article is about the threat invasive species present to an environment .
They are both different from the pythons because they are not even close to the some spices .
And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size .
Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis .
Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm .
The article says `` '' invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity . '' ''
A .
Then the author explains what exactly is space junk and how it is formed .
White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees .
The amount of vinegar needed is essential information .
First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about .
The author divides the article up into separate sections .
He had to go .
It exploded , but it still tried to eat it .
^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length .
Mr. Leonard said ' I looked good back then , did n't I ? '
Even if it is just a small thing floating around , it could cause alot of harm .
SHE DOSE N'T WANT TO HURT HER AUNT 'S FEELINGS SO SHE DOES N'T ANWSER HER AUNT .
They needed to include what time they started and when they ended .
If the sizes vary , the data found is useless .
It would n't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is .
Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul .
In this experiment students tested to see
1 .
Learning Mr. Leonard 's background information , Paul becomes more interested in his life .
The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader 's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope !
In T1 , A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm .
`` The data provided concludes that plastic type `` '' B '' '' stretched the most .
Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers .
This connection rises from the fact that they both struggle with reading .
Rose says to Anna in the story that 'He had to go .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least .
One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure .
Once he finds this out , he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past .
He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic .
They could have also add more trials to improve their design .
Give a start and stop time put safety googles on .
First , in the product it just said pour vinegar .
Then the article goes on to say that space junk is becoming a problem .
This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader .
A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most .
When Paul confronts him , He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read , Like himself .
One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup .
He uses sub headings such as 'What Is Space Junk ' , and 'Crash Course ' .
A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use .
The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read .
Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need .
They describe how it is becoming more and more of a problem .
She is very determined .
Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
The author starts with a introduction .
This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading .
How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde .
Paul read Mr. Grabowski website and finally figured out that he could n't read either .
In that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off Paul 's college loans .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both mainly eat one type of food .
The panda mainly eats bamboo as the Koala maily eat eucalyptus leaves .
Osmosis is diffusion only it is with water .
The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are : ^p 1 .
The tRNA codes for an amino acid .
Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane .
The day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her .
Out of all the plastic , plastic A is the stretchiest .
He starts with an attention grabing introduction .
Paul was all too familiar with the words Mr. Leonard had said .
Also in the table include how much each weights were added on .
An what type of vinegar , I would be more specific .
Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard .
Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights .
The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding .
and to improve , the validity they should have done a third trial .
One trait is that Rose is optimistic ; she looks at things positively .
The next section , 'Crash Course , ' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide .
And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity 's that will never come again .
To replicate this procedure , you would need to know many things .
Why ?
As Mr. Leonard finishes , Paul indirectly offers to help Mr. Leonard with learning to read better .
While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm .
He realized that although he could n't read either , Mr. Leonard suceeded in a way .
To keep data acorte .
I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample .
Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space .
Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials .
Paul relates to him because he has the same difficulties as Mr. Leonard .
In each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system .
a , The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A .
describes what 'space junk ' is and how it negatively affects the environment .
She is considerate of her family 's feelings and their situation .
Some form of passive transport include osmosis , diffusion , and facilitated diffusion .
This could effect the mass of the object at the end .
The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials .
Passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances .
The author organizes this article in a simple , yet effective way .
Type two is active transport .
Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results .
white : : i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white .
Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul .
Pythons can eat , really anything and live anywhere making survival easy .
9 ) .
Based on the results of the experiment , plastic type B had the least overall stretch .
China 's panda 's eat bamboo and koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves which are both plants .
He concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk .
Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard , 'It 's time to start your training . '
Then , he went into Crasc Course which is talking about craches that has happened over the years .
Complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species .
In the end of the story , Paul takes Mr. Leonard to help him with his reading disability .
`` 1 .
Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are .
The auther organizes the articles by titles about what he wants to talk about .
Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him .
Paul explains how he feels the same way now as Mr. Leonard had in the past .
I also need to know how to find the difference in mass .
This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating .
Paul gets a little suprised on what he finds out about Mr. Leonard .
b .
It requires no energy , so it is called anerobic .
^p B .
As this occurs , ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein .
I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring .
The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples .
Rose believed that if she told the truth it would hurt Aunt Kolab 's feelings .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists .
All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard .
`` This group needs to include quantitative information such as , `` '' How much vinegar '' '' .
These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment .
Paul wants to help him , just as he helped Paul .
He then sets a historical background and defines the term 'space junk . '
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists while pythons are generalists .
Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm .
I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment .
When Rose 's Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down , Rose did not answer .
This experiment is missing too much information .
The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well .
Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use .
What containers and what are we supposed to label ?
In order to replicate the experiment , the group 's procedure should mention which samples to use .
`` Both pandas and koala bears eat plants .
Because when she is talking to her aunt she didnt want to tell the truth and hurt her feelings .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes .
The snakes are unwelcome unless kept in captivity . ''
It 's a comet !
Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell .
In the introduction , the author tries to hook the reader in about 'space junk . '
The author organizes the article in three sections .
The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first , it should include measurements .
^p - What kind of containers are being used .
One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container .
Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he could n't read either .
One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything .
Also repeat twice .
Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic .
Finally the author talks about how important it is that we try to solve the space junk problem .
For instance one plastic with no weight .
^p B ) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh .
a ) Based on the data shown , the polymer plastics will streach but not much .
^p 2 .
Paul says , ' The emotions on his face were all to familiar to me . '
Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus .
Paul realizes that he is being coached by an expert .
In step 2 , it says , pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers .
a ) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type .
He one ate a alligator .
This also tells us about the free-orbiting objests .
This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment .
Mr. Leonard asked , 'Why . '
The term invasive is just saying how the animals forced out and go to new places and live there .
China 's Panda is similar to Australia 's Koala because they both only live on one main food .
The second is called What is space junk ?
In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black .
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him and he wants to know why .
She tries to be the mother of the family for her sister Anna .
Samples of what ?
But failed out for not being able to read .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup .
`` Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
This is a very good way for the author to present their information .
There is no control so how do you know what water is .
One trait that can describe Rose is selfless .
She explained that in the long run , and the troubles have settled , that it will benefit them .
As the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species .
Also if one made all the plastics the same length .
The order is from most shotely to least B D C A .
The Author organizes this article into sections/questions for each topic .
the sections help us understand more about the space junk in space .
He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere .
What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers .
But once he got to college his friends were n't there to help him out anymore .
rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain .
After that , the author describes how satellites 'die ' and crash into each other , creating microdebris .
' , 'Crash Coarse ' , and 'Little Bits , But a BIg Deal ' .
The author organizes his/her writing into different sections based on the importance of the issue .
She would do anything for her family .
He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him .
The author organize 's the article by headlines before talking about the article .
To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting .
In order to replicate the experiment , the group of students need a control .
He wanted to know why he did not succeed in a professional level , or do anything after college .
This paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space .
An example from the article is `` in the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator ''
white : : I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature .
One trait that is shown is how she is caring .
The author organizes the article by starting at the history of space explorations .
This is because , on average , it stretched 22.5mm in length .
Next , he describes the severity of this topic .
These animals are different from the python because the python is a generalist animal .
Paul understands why Mr. Leonard put so much effort into him .
Rose 's response is , 'He had to go .
The very last section seems to be the author 's main point and the purpose of her article .
Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials .
The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story .
Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature .
The mRNA finds the ribosome.3 .
It also later goes into telling the risks of satellites controlling eachother .
The space junk is created from satellites colliding into each other and creating debris .
Rose is caring becuase immediatly after Anna walks in she asked Anna if she was was feeling okay .
Once they went native , they did n't go back .
He felt empathetic ; he understood the hall monitor 's emotions completely .
The author explains the subject through the paragraphs titled 'What Is Space Junk ? '
They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps .
When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand .
light gray : : Light Gray .
Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup .
This part is the conclusion , and talks about all the problems space junk can cause .
1 .
The author organizes this article in a text book form .
In 'Gifts ' Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes the article really well in my opinion .
^p Also , they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched .
Koalas only eats eucalyptus leaves which grow natural in Australia .
In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two .
He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him .
' I lost my scholarship and flunked out .
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused .
The author grabs the readers attention in the beggining with the phrase 'Grab your telescope !
The second section is about two satellites colliding wih one another , causing microdebris .
Plastic B , proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics .
Paul also sees this as a way to help Mr. Leonard just like he had helped him .
white : : The best color for the dog house is white .
I was a good athlete ' , 'but not a good student . '
This boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes Paul want to achieve goals .
And Mr. Leonard tells him about being a star athlete 'but not a good student . '
We only have the two lengths after they were stretched .
It lets oblects in or out of the cell .
The article is organized in a chronological way .
The first section is just the opening that catches one 's attention .
Then talks about crash couses that has happened out in space and the materials is still out there .
Additionally , the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container .
You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry .
The author separates the article in 4 different categories .
Was because he did n't know how to read .
By doing this it keeps the article organized and easy to understand .
The author uses a structure of history , cause , effect , and solution to reveal information .
Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least .
Paul who we know ca n't read turns out to be a great athlete but ca n't read .
a ) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm .
The student could say how much weight he used .
The author organizes the article , by having a funny introduction .
Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened .
What else is needed is to state the different samples needed .
Many people have gone through what he is going through .
And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best .
The author begins the article with a catchy indtroduction .
This makes Paul see him in a different light .
To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information .
'you feel ok ? '
The Panda 's eat almost nothing but bamboo .
Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics .
ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient .
The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories .
Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds .
Thease are some key things that need to be included .
This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister .
Both listing what topic they are writting about .
Little Bits , but a Big Deal explains that objects in free-orbit is an important matter .
Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1 .
But Paul also realized that him and Mr. Leonard had a lot in common , and it inspired him .
Rose is a caring person .
The last section is why the reader should care about the topic .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all to familiar to me .
His introduction catches the reader 's eye , and provokes him to want to continue reading .
The author for example talks about an American and Russian satellite colliding into each other .
White reflects more light than black .
They are similar because they are both specialist animals .
Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth , it is the strongest or least plastic plastic .
To replicate the experiment , the procedure would require more detail .
white : : the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up .
Python are generalists .
In order to replicate this group 's procedure , I would need the following information : ^p 1 .
They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency or change in the experiment .
When a new speices is introduced to an environment that animal is considered invasive .
One character trait that describes Rose is thoughtfulness .
The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses .
In the way that they both just eat mainly one type of plant .
They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in .
In the next paragraph they are saying how the Space Junk even gets there .
A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup .
He does n't feel out of place .
black : : Black will absorb more heat , therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year .
The background information that Paul recieves connects with him .
^p b ) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial .
This article is organized with a fairly common format .
The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting ( mm ) .
Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples .
How long to rinse it in water ( materials ) .
He worked with Mr. Leonard and never gave up on him just like he was not given up on .
A ) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials .
' , they quickly describe what space junk is and how it is created .
2 .
white : : The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside .
Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments .
For example , I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample .
It 's time to start your training . '
Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel , and feel like he was worth something .
He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past .
How much vinegar should be pour into the containers .
Lastly , you would need to know how long to note samples for .
each section is wsell informed and organized .
Is conclusion , plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less .
Also , they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same .
She is really caring and sincere .
At the end paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Then he explains space elxploration , then talks about satellites and finally explains the danger of space junk .
Than last he talks about space trash .
It also tells about how it is increasing and becoming more of a problem .
In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container .
The author organizes this article by using an introduction first and then three sections , 'What is Space Junk ?
In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest .
Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic .
This is what makes them different from pythons , because pythons are generalist species .
A ) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability .
you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer .
When Anna has a bad dream , Rose says , `` What 's wrong ?
The first process is possessing a passive transport .
The significance of the word invasive is that these reptiles are called invasive .
1 .
The student could improve the experiment by through , if he tells us which amount of weight he used .
He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read .
The author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about .
The author organizes the article by first stating that space junk can be dangerous .
Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials ?
After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him , he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out .
.
black : : The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter .
^P b .
Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot .
She puts that second though .
Mr. Leonard explains that he could n't read , and that he flunked out of college .
The header stating 'Crash Course ' has the information about what happens when two satellites collide .
Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples .
The author organizes the article from most important to the least important .
What Is Space Junk tells you about how junk got there in the first place .
Paul now understands why Mr.Leonard wanted to help Paul be on the track team .
I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism .
Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out .
In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested .
This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use .
You broke records . '
tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA .
After reading the groups procedure , I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring .
Therefore , light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse .
Then he 'll get a job and pay for you and me to go to college . '
All in all , Mr. Leonard , wants Paul to succeed unlike he did .
The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water , without using energy .
Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read .
One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic .
Having read the article before it , we know why this can be a terrible occurence .
In the Everglades in a very rare case a python attempted to eat a alligator and exploded .
^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials .
Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand .
He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close .
Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well .
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on Paul .
By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate .
So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house .
Samples of what ?
The snakes , he says , are are impelling 5 endangered species in the Florida Keys '' '' .
Then the author says the the problem of space trash is increasing due to commercial space travel .
Then the author tells the reaeder why they should care about space junk .
So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment .
( 'She felt too young for so much responsibility ... imagining how her brother must feel . ' )
This shows that she cares about how other people feel .
Generalists eat more than one type of food and can adapt to the environment around them .
For example , in the introduction 'Grab your telescope ! '
Finally it explains that tiny bits of space trash is not a big deal .
tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3 .
It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2 .
First he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction .
Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic .
He doesnt just put everything together , he makes subtitles .
As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab .
This will give him more control over the experiment .
Mr. Leonard sees a lot of himself in Paul and that reminds him of how he used to be .
On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm .
Additional information would include , what were the four different substances .
the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight .
In case there was no data table present .
It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be .
A .
To replicate the experiment , the Students need to include more detail in their procedure .
Another way is add control to the experiment .
The author begins his article with an attention-grabbing introduction with the shocking exclamations .
A third thing the procedure has n't told us is the amount of vinegar .
The fourth is called Little Bits , but a Big Deal .
The author organizes his article by starting with an introduction which he uses to pull the reader in .
The ammount of added weight should be specified .
And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used .
After that they tell you about the crash course .
To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples .
The trait that Rose has is responsability .
The author starts off by giving background information about junk that orbits in the 'Orbiting Junk ' headline .
In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm .
Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should 've included how much weight .
Active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient.2 .
Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful .
Like Paul , Mr. Leonard was not a very good reader as made apparent by his college background .
tool bag ? '
Then the author tells the readers about what spack junk is exactly and how it becomes space junk .
Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane .
Plastic D stretched 20 mm 's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4 .
Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track .
Just saying samples is not specific enough .
the protein then goes and does its job in the body .
Another is where should the samples sit in sun , or indoors , this may have an affect .
Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA .
Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo , and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
The word `` '' invasive '' '' helps to provide debate on this article . ''
He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner .
b .
It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete .
Lastly , the author explains how dangerous space trash and space pollution is .
After that , nobody wanted a runner that could not read .
This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is .
To this day , as he is telling the story to Paul , he is still unable to read .
Will we completely submerge it or only partially ?
The python is a generalist species , meaning that they have a larger range of adaptation .
An example is 'Its only been four months , ' Rose said as gently as she could .
He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done .
Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ .
Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer .
) Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
It 's a tool bag ? '
Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist .
Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track .
They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials , and have the plastics of the same lenghth .
He was very organize and got his point across .
The Burmese python living in the wild is now found in the U.S . ''
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps .
Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags .
Based on her conversation with Anna , Rose can be seen as mature .
Then , background information on space exploration and what 'space junk ' really is .
I need to pour on each of pour seperate , but dentical containers .
He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem .
You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment .
According to the article .
Paul didn understand why he quiet .
'What Is Space Junk ? '
Plastic
8 ) .
Rose can be descirbed as hopeful .
You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
just like humans .
The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh .
The author organizes the article well .
In the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
The author starts off with an attention grabber , allowing the audience to get hooked and read more .
^p b .
Another is , what kind of containers do they want us using ?
So Paul asked him 'What happened after that ?
A ) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest .
This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family .
^p B ) The student could have performed another trial .
Paul is shocked when he finds out who Mr. Leonard realy is .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him .
This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out .
The background information gives Paul a sense of connection with Mr. Leonard .
Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials , which was the smallest length .
`` `` Invasive '' '' means a lot to this article . ''
She is hopeful saying maybe life would get better .
This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship .
Rose is compassionate towards others .
Obviously , when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul , he saw himself as a child .
This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains .
A python on the other hand is able to live and survive in many habitats .
Paul felt a feeling of understanding .
He aslso includes that the problem is getting worse but agencies hope to work together to reduce space pollution .
^p - What to label each of the separate containers .
One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups .
a ) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm .
Lastly , information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours .
I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on .
After that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal .
They end the article by describing how the bits of fragments can cause the Earth and satilites big problems .
The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard 's past .
The author starts off the passage with a comical line , 'Grab your telescope !
1 .
Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics .
How pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat one thing nothing but it .
He could n't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college .
It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites , capsules , telescopes etc .
One trait the describes Rose is hard working .
Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors .
The author organizes the article by dividing the entire article into certain sections .
Mr. Leonard , although not able to read , was successful at other things including track .
She could just law down and say ' I quit , ' but she does n't .
Rose 's conversations with her Aunt Kolab shows that she is a caring person .
They both struggled with reading .
Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records .
It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate .
And two , taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type .
More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes .
white : : If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and do not require a specific type of food .
The least stretched plastic was type A .
To replicate the experiment , I would have to know the size of its containers I use .
Eventually , Paul was able to join the track team .
Rose is a caring person .
To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing .
The author organizes the article very well .
The is how the author organizes this article .
^p B . )
It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college .
The backrground information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on him .
Mr. Leonard could n't read , so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it .
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species .
Paul probably did n't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard .
Mr. Leonard accomplish much , by setting national records and being one of the best runner .
Each sample should be the same size .
When i get low to the ground .
Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records .
She would rather suffer herself than make anyone else hurt .
Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he does n't learn to read .
At the end of the article the author tell the harmful effects space trash can cause .
Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete .
After that , they start with statistics that shock the reader .
The author uses titles that break the article down into smaller categories to organize the text .
The second section is explaining what the space just is .
Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar .
What do you measure the mass in
And finally , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers .
When paul found out that Mr.Leonard was an amazing college track star paul was amazed .
They begins as pets but somehows escape into the wild .
No matter the size of the debris , the speed can cause serious damage .
Passive uses no energy to move proteins across a cell membrane .
And also that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was .
The author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used .
You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are .
The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA .
a ) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most .
Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids .
She seems hopeful , even though she has it rough .
Rosa said to Anna 'What 's wrong/ You feel okay ? . '
How much vinigar must be poored into each container .
and Paul is the same way .
The background information on Mr.Leonard surprises Paul .
Also , they should have included before and after length in their design table .
Chinas pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because as the author states in paragraphs 19-21 they are specialists .
When Paul asks 'what happened after that ?
Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane .
There too Mr. Leonard 's freshmen year in collage he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals .
Because he cant read all that well , but he is good at track .
By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one .
`` Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because of what they eat .
In the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier .
He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts .
Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something .
a ) Plastic B stretches the most .
1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2 .
Rose seems very caring and compassionate toward others .
And together , they can help each other have faith .
So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading .
One trait that describes Rose is understanding .
1 .
The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself .
Whereas , pythons have a much larger diet and con eat almost anything .
And Australias Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves and us ' also not harmful like the panda .
In trial 1 it stretched 22mm , and trial 2 it streached 23mm .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they depend entirely on their location to survive .
Then how people need to learn about the junk that can damage the spacecraft in space while traveling .
The background information about Mr. Leonard has an astronomical effect on Paul .
I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy .
Additional information I would need to know would include several things .
The author then talks about satellites and how they can become dead and just float freely in space .
The last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article .
'why did n't you tell me about this ? '
Without the table , a lot would n't be known by looking just at the procedure .
They are different because they are both not specialist .
the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse .
They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time .
The author starts off with an interesting introduction that slowly brings you into the rest of the article .
Both creatures depend in mainly one food source .
Rose is caring , when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family .
It did n't say how much which is important .
The author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together .
The introduction is an attention grabber so you will want to read the article .
Then , the author explains the dangers of the space junk .
This type of diffusion requires ATP .
Paul was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard could n't read either .
The Author organizes this article in three different sections .
Though just a lowly hall monitor , Mr. Leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star .
The author incorporated alot of information into a very well written article .
Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar .
You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup .
The second process is osmosis .
This is because the results are inconsistant .
you also need a control group .
They must should be specific .
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because , they both mostly eat leaves .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average of 22.5mm of stretchability .
'What Is Space Junk ? '
So they should say the names of it .
This also makes him want to help with his reading problems .
She feels pressure but still feels the need to help the best way she can .
To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container .
Then the author provides the reader with a specific example of how harmful and serious space junk can be .
It does n't say if the samples were put in different locations .
Then it goes in to what is space junk which decribes what space junk really is .
When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot , it can sleep outside .
First , the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
Paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him .
This tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information .
Rose is thoughtful and caring .
More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water .
to describe what 'space junk ' is .
Also , how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample ?
( A ) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least .
The Author oraganizes this artices very well .
There , a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA .
However when Paul learns Mr. Leonard is illiterate , he feels sympathetic because they have a common condition .
Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman .
Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he could n't read also .
Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read .
Therefore , the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2 .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is caring for others .
The background information on Mr. Leonard is impowering for Paul in specific ways .
Both pandas and koalas are specialist species .
My conclusion is that , based on the data , plastic B has the most stretchability .
She does n't want to hurt others around her so she keeps many of her feelings inside .
and he said , ' I lost my scholarship and flunked . '
Also , you would need to know what size and shape the samples are .
Rose was trying to let Anna know that everything would be alright once Paul recieved a job .
The group could have also included information about the vinegar 's temp , which is an important constant .
She knows she has a job to look out for her family .
The author organizes the article by having a introduction as being a attention getter .
While Ana believes family should come before work and money .
They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers .
Type B stretched the most at 23 mm .
Rose truly puts her family first .
And Paul wanted to help .
so black would be the best colo r
To Mr. Leonard .
So the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals .
Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are .
I also would need to know how many trials were their .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes .
The author starts off with background information starting off with facts about the first artificial satellite .
The python , a generalist , is extremely adaptive and is not roled to one single food supply .
Does not tell her that she is .
Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead .
'Hey my friend , where do you think your going ? '
The procedure is unclear .
Just like paul .
In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm .
They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller .
The author talks about how satellites collide in to eachother and produced space debris .
He was curious to why Mr. Leonard had not ran anymore after that .
a .
As for white is would get the least amount of heat .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
he says they are `` '' introduced '' '' and are less of a threat than the government thinks .
She asked this to Anna , even though Rose herself was n't well .
The author organizes the article by explaining in the introductory paragraph what the topic of the writing is .
The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length .
During the story 'Gifts ' Paul learns some interesting and shocking information about Mr Leonard .
Mr. Leonard helps to push Paul on and off the track to perform well and try hard .
Both ?
To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used .
Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes .
He explains every topic in a different section .
She is also very appreciative in this example .
First is a small , shocking anecdote , which serves to grab the attention of the reader .
Based on the data , plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics .
Lastly , they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container .
Rose is careing person .
He does this first by talking about the 'Orbiting Junk ' and then by 'What is space Junk ? '
The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it .
Learning about Mr. Leonard 's past helps Paul in many ways .
Each have atleast two paragraph .
When he is talking about space junk , he labels that section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The hall monitor , Mr. Leonard , decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling .
^P b .
In the third section titled 'Crash Course ' , the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse .
First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container .
Also , how much vinegar should we pour , and in what sort of container ?
When Rose is talking to Anna , she tells her that what her family is doing is necessary .
One trait that Rose demonstrates is that she is hard working .
We start of with the Orbiting Junk subgroup , which is the opening paragraghs .
Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did n't continue in track and field after that race .
Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye .
Pandas can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptis .
and ends with 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck ?
One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person .
He finds out they both has the same weaknesses .
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard struggled reading , he was confused .
He feels a reason .
They are n't spreading around the world and are different from pythons because pythons are dangerous and spreading .
Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him .
white : : The best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white .
He was suspicious , so he decide to ask Mr. Leonard .
Overall , the author did a great job of informing the reader about his point of view .
WSR
Pandas and koala bears are similar because they are both bears .
`` A ) In conclusion plastic type `` '' B '' '' could stretch the most .
Paul decides he 's going to work harder in school and at track .
I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples .
Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested .
mr. leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read , bc they didnt have help centers .
These help to move different things across a cell .
^P Measure the height of the table , weigh the weights .
white : : The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways .
1 .
The effect Mr. Leonard 's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him .
'What is Space junk , ' 'Crash course , ' and etc .
These subtitles give the readers something to think about before the read that specific section of the article .
talks about background unformation such as when the first satellie was launched .
when he hid that secret about him quitting track because of his grades shocked the narrator .
An example would be , Paul can not read and neither can Mr. Leonard .
You would also need to know how they determined the mass .
Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space .
He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle , he still have to study very hard .
Also , you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers .
The article is organized into sections .
Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment .
^p b ) The students could have done more trials .
In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used .
He see 's that anyone can do anything if they have help .
Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane , but it does not require energy .
The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk .
What plastic , how long are they etc .
^p B ) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for .
For example under 'What Is Space Junk ?
To finish the process , a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon .
Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle .
The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer .
allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they both eat one common food .
Rose could be considered protective towards her family .
white : : It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse .
In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure .
The author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit .
^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it 's left hanging .
To conclude the polymer investigation , according to data , plastic A is the Stretchiest .
That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path .
Lastly , we need to know the concentration of the vinegar .
Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic .
Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals , and he took that opportunity .
Finally , in the last section , the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced .
Mr. Leonard had reading problems when he was around Pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports .
Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul , Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard .
This is the effect which Mr. Leonard 's background information had on Paul .
'Crash Course , which was to provide details about how satellies have crashed due to this debris .
^p b ) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific .
Rose is hopeful .
Second , I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup .
In the text it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
It helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialist for their countries .
^p b ) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial .
Based on the students data , plastic type B is the stretchiest .
Also what would those 4 materials be .
In the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration .
Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination .
A python swallowed an alligator .
It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles , but was n't the best student .
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could n't read , like himself .
The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction , and three sub topics .
They can go anywhere and eat anything .
The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same .
These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment .
It made Paul think that he has someone who understands his troubles with reading .
Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least .
Otherwise , we could n't even start the experiment .
Rose could n't answer in fear of hurting her aunt or her mother .
Also , for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials .
Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times .
How much vinegar goes in each sample .
How pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia is that they are both bears that eat plants .
For example , the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers .
Therefore when he ( Paul ) learns of Mr. Leonard 's past he feels a relation between them .
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
black : : Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors .
( Paul , P 45 . )
Because the color is not that dar k , but not that light ether .
In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information .
They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles .
^P b .
The codon and anticodon bind , and form an amino acid .
She can not attend because she is willing to work to keep her job .
The autor organizes the article by making different headlines for different topics .
There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment .
Hopeful .
The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable .
The author first starts out with a good attention getter to get you woundering what space junk is .
it then goes to the ribosomes .
This gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article .
Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use .
:
And state how much weight is being added to the plastic .
most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm .
One trait that can describe Rose from the conversation with Aunt Kolab is conflicted .
You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in .
Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways .
It means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing .
Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup .
The author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the reader 's attention .
The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion .
She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna .
The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better .
How does the author title the article , he titles is to help the reader .
It 's a comet !
Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit .
By breaking records at his old high school he would go on to collage and run track .
Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp .
One trait that describes Rose , based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined .
Paul does n't feel so alone anymore .
The author first begins with an introduction to what the article will be about .
He or she then tells you what space junk is .
I would need to know how to measure I samples .
It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount .
In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known .
One trait that Rose has shown is hopefulness .
After the conversation with Aunt Kolab she was confident that her life could get easier .
a .
First , knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space .
Also increase the weight in the second trial .
Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse .
They are similar because they both only eat one thing and they are specialists .
' , indicating that he is going to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
That made Paul want to study harder than before .
Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material .
-Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane .
The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees .
He remembered what it was like to be in his position .
The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him .
Pandas and Australia 's koala bears are similar .
The author organizes the article by using the classic topical structure .
They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live off of eating many different foods .
If you can achieve a goal you can do anything .
The author organize his artivle very well .
^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment .
They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results .
I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm .
They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic .
There for it stretched the greatest amount .
by telling you what space junk is .
They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated , and get very uncomfortable .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both require special native food .
Also they could 've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial .
The author categorizes this article .
Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her .
Like , at the end after learning Mr. Leonard 's past and how he ca n't read .
I would need to know where to put all of the different containers .
From the experiment , plastic type B came to be the most stretchable .
a ) In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics .
With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results .
A list of materials . ''
The author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
Do you feel okay ? '
An example from the article is ; ( last paragraph ) Rose kept nodding .
It is all under the main Topic , Orbiting Junk .
Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard .
This lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere .
When Mr. Leonard came along and helped boost his confidence .
It is almost a 'payback ' deal , except Paul is happy to help Mr. Leonard .
Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister .
In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family .
So , Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul .
The chain that is created is a protein .
To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant .
This story occurred in Februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris .
And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm .
It 's a meteor ! '
Now , with the understanding that he can achieve , he feels reason to pay back the favor .
You also need to know how much vinegar you using , you may also need to know how much you
^p B ) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic .
So he decided he could help Mr.Leonard out by training him .
Plastic type B stretches the most ( 22.5 ) .
She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too .
Paul says , 'Mr .
Different environments could affect the date .
Passive transport does not require energy , the molecules just pass through the membrane .
In the introduction , the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way .
Looking at the student 's data , you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability .
^p 2 .
The size of the containers you are using .
The author puts the story in different sections .
A python though does n't need as specific of living arrangnents besides a warm climate .
One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials .
When he questions him , and finds out the truth , he says , ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard .
Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock .
The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative .
Then , the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon .
Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood .
For example the very first paragraph after the introduction has a headline that says What Is Space Junk ?
The first section is called Orbiting Junk .
He was just a little confused on why he did not tell him first .
Mr. Leonard , like Paul , had trouble reading .
She begins the conversation with Anna by asking , 'Are you worried ? '
In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another .
He was amd excelent athlete but just like Paul , he struggled with learning and reading .
a . )
The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand .
Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well .
They are also different from pythons because of the weather climate that pandas and koalas live in .
Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on .
Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles .
Their hypothesis was correct .
Make a control having the clamp ( without weight ) be measured .
Meanwhile pythons have a variety of things to eat from .
They both only eat one kind of food , bamboo or eucalyptus leaves .
How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using ?
Paul was suprized at what Mr Leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out .
The author organizes the article by putting them into different sections on space exploration .
He says he knew the feelings well .
The author organizes the article by putting specific ideas together .
Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard is still not doing the trck meets still .
a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2 .
To replicate this procedure I 'll need to know the size of the containers .
He became more interested in Mr. Leonard 's past in college .
For example , he puts information about space junk in 'What Is Space Junk ' .
1 .
a . )
Diffrent sections depending on what the paragaph was about .
What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person .
Humans have animals as pets , a large and potray source .
^p 2 .
Each section tells us more and more about this arising problem in space .
Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch .
I would need to know several things before replicating this job .
This section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the Earth .
What is Space Junk ?
In the experiment , it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size .
White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar .
In order to replicate the experiment , i would need to know a saw things .
An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching .
Finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read either .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information , what are four samples ?
He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment .
Thoughtful .
She went from school , straight to her work , and then right back home to help her aunt .
What kind of samples ?
Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid .
Diffusion is a high concentration to a low concentration .
They could have used more trials .
He seperates it into different sectoins such as What is Spacr junk ?
The side heading prozide an organized map for the reader to follow .
Theres only certain places pandas and kolas can live but as pythons begin to expand they live everywhere .
The data shows that in both trials ( T1 and T2 ) , plastic B stretched 22 and 23 .
This shows that both animals are specialists because they would n't survive in most environments .
Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A .
They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched .
Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard and Paul wants to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes this article in a very organized way .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
Pythons can adapt to many diverse climates .
At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone .
In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things .
Panda and koala bears differ from pythons based on what they eat . ''
In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard .
The author finishes this article by telling the reader that space trash is on the rise .
Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm .
To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container .
Pandas in China only eat bamboo , koalas in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Pandas in China , and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialists .
^p B ) They could have done more trial and try other plastics .
This process terminates at a stop codon .
One reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them .
He then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head .
Not specifying this could lead to variations of data , and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment .
for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk .
Finally , cells use active transport , which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy .
In step 2 , you need to be told how much vinegar to pour .
Next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious .
More trials can show a trend in the data while only two ca n't .
Also , step 3 should be switched with step 2 .
In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know what the samples were .
How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use ?
She decides to tell her aunt of this dream .
Both pandas and koalas eat only one thing .
The temperature used for explanation w as the average .
One trait that Rose has is thoughtfulness .
I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone .
Maybe her life would get easier .
In addition , there is an information about how they determined the mass .
^p b .
This continues , creating a strand of amino acids , until a stop codon is reached .
Rose is willing to work for her family and do anything for them .
Last , they have Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog .
That is why she is a very giving person .
Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star .
She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States .
Look up in the sky !
Two ; They could have had more than 2 trials .
I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment .
a .
Little did Paul know , but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner .
Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers .
She thinks the best of each situation , and hopes and dreams that things will get better .
He connects with him , and feels sorry for him .
Pandas in China in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole , only sizable for it .
It explains that it 's not going , like , five miles and hour , but THOUSANDS !
a .
You would need a scale to measure the different containers .
One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar .
Then finally how these little peices of debri can become lethal .
Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm , 23m T2 .
^p To improve the validity of the experiment , the students could name the four plastics used .
Paul was also shocked to the discovery that Mr. Leonard could n't read either .
He realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because he is not a good reader either .
Rose does n't want to hurt anyone 's feelings .
The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results .
How much weight am I supposed to add .
The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials .
It can even distory spaceships .
Having sections makes it easier to find the information you 're looking for .
Based on the student 's data , plastic type B stretched the most .
Rose is carimg .
However , they vary from a python because a python can live numerous places throughout the world .
This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials .
The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights .
They are diffrent because a python eats what animals , and the panda & koala eat leaves and bamboo .
A .
His attitude and the way he sees things change completely .
He began 'training ' Mr. Leonard to read well .
Mr.Leonard backround show his difficalty in reading just like Paul .
This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard .
Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability ) .
Look up at the sky !
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship .
Suddenly I realized what I could for him . '
Rose is caring .
Exocytosis .
They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails .
How long the samples , how much the vinegar , at how big should containers be .
In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12 .
He could of also told how heavy the weights were .
It suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic .
These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results .
One trait is that Rose is a caring person , that loves and respects her aunt .
Mr. Leonard did n't have a Learning Center back then , that would help him with his grades .
The third section , 'Crash Course ' , shows how the problem began .
Therefore , Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother .
Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius .
b .
This gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph .
They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment .
He tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box .
Rose asks her younger sister , Anna , what 's wrong and if she is feeling okay .
He also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution .
They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh .
Osmosis is similar to diffusion , but occurs with water .
By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better .
a ) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials .
The author then describes why there is space junk .
She firsts askes her sister is she was okay .
Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is .
Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles .
After they go out onto the track .
For example , the article says that the pythons in Florida are imperiling five endangered species .
Mr. Leonard could n't read .
He makes the topics seperated like this to look almost like a newspapper and to show each is important .
Reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports .
This shows that unlike pandas and koalas , pythons can adapt to other environments .
In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm .
After that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth .
In saying sections , I am referring to the titles through out the article .
The introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections .
I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author .
This man had to given the time to help me excel at something .
To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get .
For step three , it does n't specify what material or what size container to put the material in .
But Mr. Leonard was more then just a hall monitor .
In his procedure , it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely .
Another thing the student can do is add one more trial .
When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history , Paul could relate .
Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard 's kindness by helping teach him as Paul learns .
One trait about Rose in this story is when Rose has a conversation with her younger sister Anna .
The student should have told , how heavy the weights were .
She says this to try to comfort her sister who is upset about Papa leaving .
The dog would n't want a hot sweaty dog house .
Paul finds out that Mr , Leonard has a reading disability .
You need to know how bigof a container .
a ) .
They end the article with telling of the dangers of microdebris .
( sentence number 12 )
In conclusion trial any
That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler .
Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3 .
This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit .
In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm .
The author organizes this article by dividing it up into topics in order to capture the reader 's attention .
Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending reading , like himself .
For example a graph chart .
The author organizes this article into different sections that explain about different things .
`` I would include the materials used or the `` '' samples '' '' .
Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they do n't eat everything .
During Rose 's conversation with her aunt , the passage says , 'Rose did n't answer .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him .
1 .
Animals have been divided into two sections ; specialists and generalists .
It also makes Paul look up to Mr. Leonard .
So , Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard .
thing this
Panda 's eat nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves rarely .
'No school wanted a runner who could n't read . '
The mRNA then heads to a rRNA , where synthesis can begin .
When Paul goes to the track coach , the coach tells Paul to look up the name 'Grabowski . '
Mr. Leonard ca n't read but was a very good athlete .
The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials .
Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
Also , the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container .
Active transport-requires energyPassive transport- requires no energyosmosis- the movement of water from one place to another
It was easily the longest .
'What Is Space Junk ?
You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used .
It had the most streching for both the first and second trial , 22mm and 23 mm .
In short , invasive is passing judgement '' '' over the reptiles saying they 're invasive `` '' . ''
The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it .
Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient .
In the same way , Paul wishes to assist Mr. Leonard to achieve something .
The different headings talk about some of the topics that have to do with space junk .
It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into .
He ca n't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college .
Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate , but Paul can simpathize .
Also , about how America and Russian satellites crashed into eachother right about earth .
Second , step 2 says , pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar .
Rose is veryunderstanding .
The author begins the article with an attention getting introduction , followed by historicle statistics .
In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color .
They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic .
white : : I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature .
When Paul heard that they had something in common and he knew how to relate to him .
black : : Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black .
The first three paragraphs get you hooked into the story and make you want to read more .
First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results .
Rose is a caring person .
Bamboo is a plant grown in Japan .
The background information influences Paul to push himself .
A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid .
How big should they be .
I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings , or thoughts before their own is a careing person .
This means that they only eat specific items , such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
He then added the section 'Crash Course ' to provide information on satellite crashes .
Pythons are different than pandas and Koalas because pythons need to eat more than just leaves all day .
For example , the subtopic 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial .
There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water .
Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows .
Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers .
'Rose did n't answer .
She speaks about Paul and how he will eventually come back to help them .
They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable .
A panda and a koala are both vegetarians .
The author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information .
The first part of the artice he uses the word space junk .
The four major steps are that the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein .
white : : that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time .
Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard could n't read .
Rose didnt answer .
Each article is different making the reader able to understand it easier .
The author started with an opening paragraph explaining what the article is going to be discussing .
They should have used exact measurement when saying to `` '' add weight '' '' to the clamp .
I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers .
The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers .
The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell .
She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt .
They are similar because they both only eat a very small range of foods , they are specialists .
a .
Just like with the jar l id when it was black , it absorbed the most .
suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
It can eat a variety of things , it can change .
I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical , container .
To tell me what the samples are in the procedure .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read just like himself .
The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on .
The author organizes the article in discriptive paragraphs .
After that he gives you a few references to some accidents that relate to his topic .
^P b . )
When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard 's past , he does n't get discouraged .
Rose , although feeling pressured , does n't want to make things harder on anyone or to hurt anyone .
12 degree difference !
so he told mr. leonard its time to start your training
Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I 've labeled them .
He also did n't know how to read and was becoming a great athlete .
Paul had experienced some of the same things that Mr. Leonard described from college .
Basically , it is a well organized informative essay .
Paul realized Mr. Leonard was like him in many ways .
This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up .
At first , he admires Mr.Leonard .
the average temperature is 42 ( DEG ) c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
In paragraph 39 , Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard 's success .
Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane .
In this article invasive means living in an environment where an organism should n't be .
This means they have more places where they can survive .
In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability .
It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided .
Populations , they are invasive .
Each head title for each paragraph has an intriguing sentence and then the paragraph has supportive details and facts .
You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water .
3 .
We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space .
That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using .
This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors .
Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class .
They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2 .
So the all came out equal .
Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm .
However , these results are not valid .
Also plastic type A has the least stretchability .
He or she included a variety of information in each of these sections .
Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled ?
The third section describes the dangerous collisions that take place in space between the different satellites and such .
Pandas and koalas are both specialist species and only eat , one type of food .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most , and plastic type A stretched the least .
Paul must feel proud of being coached by one of the best track stars .
A .
Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag .
For example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
Also , they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion .
Paul felt inspired .
Rose is caring .
That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house .
It turns out Mr. Leonard was n't a good reader either , and flunked out of college .
Rose is very understanding .
In conclusion , it can be said that plastic .
The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him .
^P b ) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails .
white : : By painting the dog house white , it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler .
The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read .
To organize the article , the author breaks up the information into different categories .
'what 's wrong ?
^p b ) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added .
This would make the experiment valid when reproduced .
^p b .
However , pythons eat meat , like other animals .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read .
The author organizes the article well , by putting information in certain sections .
For example , Skin Snow says that the snakes are unwanted and are eating endangered species .
He concludes with why these issues matter and how people should work to confront them .
How much vinegar are whe poring ?
Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams .
Then he 'll get a good job , Anna , and he 'll pay for our college . ' .
Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level .
You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup .
The group also need to specify what the `` '' samples '' '' are .
`` Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment , one is todo more trials .
It should have a constant mass for each of the samples .
Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles , and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading .
One of these traits is she has never complained about helping to pay for Paul 's college education .
The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they 're both specialists .
^p 2 .
( The temperature should be consistant )
In return , Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
The author organizees the article in an easy to understand way .
Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours ?
They are both very good at track and neither of them can read .
^p b ) .
You feel okay ? '
They also should named a common value for all the weights .
This section provides the reader with examples of satellites or debris crashing into each other at great speed .
Unlike pandas & koalas , a python eats whatever it sees , for example , one ate an alligator .
The author does a great job explaining the way that the space junk works in outer space .
These cloumns include 'What is Space Junk ?
After this , actual examples of space junk are given .
The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope .
section explains how space capsules , satellites , and teloscopes explore space .
Considerate .
The movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane.Active Transport .
This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane .
black : : Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most .
They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using .
For plastic type A , the amount stretched increased by one mm .
They would also need to know what containers they used .
He never expected that Mr. Leonard was a track star .
This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners .
' ( paragraph 38 ) .
Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete , but not a good student .
' , 'Crash Course , ' and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
Paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
Constant keep the results of experiment valid .
The movement of particles through a membrane against the concentration gradient.Passive Transport .
One Trait that shows how Rose is as a person is that she is very mature .
A generalist '' '' says the article are man 's pet .
First , a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA .
) .
He organizes it by first getting the reader 's attention by using shocking statements in the introduction .
Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy .
( line 38-39 ) .
The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration .
One section tells about the space junk and what it exactly is .
Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long .
Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials .
there , the pythons reproduce and their population i.e harming five endangered species in tile area .
They need to
To improe and compare data .
You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment .
The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting .
You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample .
Marble , limestone , wood and plastic in their procedure .
The author organizes the article by breaking bits of information down into it 's own section .
Then after they tell you about that , they tell you how unsafe little bits are .
The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him .
With plastic C , the results decreased by one mm .
The introduction , which was to get the reader interested .
The author of this article organized the paper logically .
black : : If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm .
Also to say how much weight to the clamp .
Mr. Leonard asked Paul , 'where do you think you 're going . '
3 .
Also , the students could have conducted more trials .
a ) To conclude , plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics .
Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least .
The second section , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
It would n't be too hot or to too cold .
One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using .
This could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment .
and he was disapointed thet Mr. Leonard hadnt told him about this before .
To improve this experiment , the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic .
First , it starts off how every good essay starts off .
The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial .
First , you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm .
Therefore the word invasive is important to the understanding of the story . ''
Paul now understood more things about his coach .
^P b . )
Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial .
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a runner also he is very surprised .
Overall , the article was assembled in a simple way that made it easy to understand for any reader .
In the side heading Crash Course , the story tells us of crashes in history and gives specific examples .
white : : I chose the color white for the doghouse .
^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same .
Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2 .
The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem .
Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length .
that is a trait of love .
The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy .
When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was , that inspires Paul .
They basically have the same issuses in their lifes .
You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass .
She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes .
Panda bears and koala bears are similar because they both eat one specific thing .
Paul is motivated because Mr. Leonard had the same problems Paul is sturggling with .
In 'Crash Course ' the author says how the debris is created .
The 'What is Space Junk ? '
The author trys to grab your attention at first .
Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school .
Rose asks Anna if she feels okay .
This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read .
This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center .
Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6 ( DEG ) C average .
They could 've put the same amount or different amount .
Last , it explains that problems are still existing and the amount of space crash is increasing .
A .
Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was young .
We can use plastic or metal or another .
You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted , what results where they looking for .
They did not specify how they determined the mass .
It 's a meteor !
Pandas from China and koalas in Australia are both similar because they both eat plants .
Pandas and koalas are specialists and pythons are generalists .
I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount .
For example , how much vinegar should be poured into each container ?
'Rose did n't answer .
1 .
directs that .
Rose did n't answer .
Thats why in Brandi and Jerry 's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala are similar because they are both special lists .
Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials .
The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity .
They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect .
Plastic type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second .
Unlike Mr. Leonard , he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read .
Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities .
Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard 's emotions because he too , had difficulties wtih school work .
the author than staes an instance where space junsk acused an accident .
Rose has a trait of unselfishness .
'What Is Space Junk ? '
^p 2 .
Rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok .
Also , there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid .
`` The word invasive describes how dangerous reptiles are becoming , invasive through out .
Paul does n't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track .
They both are mammals which make them different from a python .
Also other info would be , what size containers do you need for this experiment .
He felt sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because he could n't read like him .
Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane .
Osmosis .
To know that all the plastics were the same length .
Rose is very caring .
white : : If the color of the doghouse is white , this w ill keep the house cool .
The subtopic What Is Space Junk ?
Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged .
Last , you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold .
A python swallowed an alligator . ''
And train me .
And also the site of the container needed for this experiment .
It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared , stronger .
Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had , at one time , run track .
The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results .
Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2 .
`` The generalist that are spread accidentally have seen to be `` '' invasive '' '' to that environment .
The story states ' This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this .
I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched .
Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration .
The author starts on a somewhat fast pace , trying to grab the reader 's attention .
Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him .
4 .
I would need to know how to determine the mass .
By having all the mass 's the same , it would be easier to determine the difference .
In the first trial it stretched 20mm , and in the second trial it stretched 23mm .
Should it be sunny , dark , windy , hot , cold , etc .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample .
The pythons is a generalist .
Next he explains what it is and gives some background information on it .
It 's Superman ! '
That Rose was kind and did n't want to hurt anyone .
2 : The student uses samples with varying length , therefore making his results invalid .
To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment .
The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one .
He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle .
The significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem .
Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results .
They student variable unchecked .
The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add .
He organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics .
And the black would n't be a good color , because darker colors absorb more energy .
In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking .
The next section , entitled 'What Is Space Junk ?
A panda and a koala bear are similar because they pretty much each only one specific thing .
In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm .
He explains what goes on that we do n't know and that we do n't think goes on .
The article implies that we should be more careful to avoid introducing invasive species , especially in Florida . ''
Which shows that Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
light gray : : Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color .
Pythons can live in many places but koala and panda have special needs .
From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability .
Finally , the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate .
Plastic type D is the most durable .
For example , the author uses uses the subtitle 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Based on this student 's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B .
.
The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar . ''
Evident ly , black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors .
A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics .
The author organize the article by using subheading , and a strong intro .
Paul soon found out that Mr. Leonard was just like him and Paul wanted to achieve for Mr. Leonard .
Then they go on by describing what space junk actually is .
Telling us that he ca n't read , such as Paul ca n't read .
A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment .
He was good in a sport but not so good as a student .
Also , to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container .
After that section , the author writes about different occurances and the details of space junk .
Once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time .
Where as pythons have been known to swallow an alligator .
Also what type of containers should you put the samples in ?
Also , I would need to know what samples I am using .
Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane .
The author organized the article in way to guide the reader along with the information .
The author organized the article by trying to catch the reader 's attention first .
tool bad ?
The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3 .
Then we learn about how even the smallest of space debris can cause danger .
Next , they talk about how harmful these tiny fragments can be .
Also , I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list .
Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm .
Mr. Leonard 's history shows Pail what he can become .
What should we lable the 4 containers as ?
It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
The mRNA enters the ribosome .
section 'In 1957 , the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite . '
It encourages him to excel in both school and sports .
Also , when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool .
You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment .
Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched .
The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water .
He starts out with an intro and mentions 'space junk ' .
You broke records . '
Pythons are invasive reptiles . ''
This means they consume lots of things that an ecosystem needs which makes said area less diverse . ''
With this additional information , one could now replicate the experiment .
In order to replicate this experiment , you would need to know what the samples were .
She is very sincere and thinks about other people 's and cares about other people 's feelings .
Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane .
Then plastic type S , then C and finally A , which has the least amount of stretchability .
Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found .
black : : the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists .
That background information about Mr. Leonard shocks Paul .
tool bag ? '
For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A .
Paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them .
2 .
The article is organized chronoligically .
Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler .
In the Second body paragraph he explains how collisions of the satallites make and become space junk .
The author organizes this article in to sections .
He follows this by presenting a potential problem that arises with this topic , appropriately named 'Crash Course ' .
Rose is very hopeful .
Then how she has to work to help support her entire family .
They need these specific things to survive .
They could of also tell us a specific weight .
Based on the student data , plastic type B stretched the most .
Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read .
1 .
With more specific information this would be a well written procedure .
It should say what each `` '' sample '' '' is in the procedures .
This includes the problem of satelights running into each other .
Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at .
Now he realizes he is n't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident .
or by a light source makes a difference too .
The author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way .
^p b .
There diets are just completely different .
Knowing this information , it had a great effect on Paul .
Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B .
I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup .
The procedure should contain what different samples are going to weighed .
Paul now understood that he could overcome his problems to and become a hurdler like Mr. Leonard .
The last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are .
Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard ca n't read , like Paul .
'It 's time to start your training . '
Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better .
For example , adding little heat .
By doing this I believe it makes the article more effective and easier to read .
We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples .
She shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and Anna .
Paul realizes that if Mr. Leonard can be a great hurdler than he can .
What are the four different samples ?
You broke records . '
to get the reader involved and to provide factual information .
He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star .
They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container .
He wants Paul to achieve success .
The author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers ' eye .
Next Anna stands up and says Rose sounds like mom .
A .
And that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center .
`` `` step 1 '' '' cut a 2omm strip of each plastic '' '' .
'Anna , ' Rose said .
To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA .
A ) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it 's greatest length was 23mm .
Paul shows this in paragraph 43 .
He explains how satellites ran into eachotherr and caused hundreds of peices of debris in the air .
Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics .
She does n't want to hurt others so she watchs what she says and is respectful .
The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest .
He found out that Mr. Leonard also had , and still does , trouble reading .
Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers ( loose bonding ) .
The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length .
Rose said as gently as she could .
Paul then feels motivated to 'train ' Mr. Leonard in reading .
This is proven by the data gathered by the trials .
Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different .
The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog .
a .
Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite .
Most generalist species are invasive because they look for different places to live .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both specialists animals .
Rose is a very caring person .
All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know .
In order to replicate the experiment , the procedure would have to add more details .
In order to complete this experiment , three aditional thing should be included .
I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid .
Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight .
He wants to do something nice for Mr. Leonard just like he did for him .
They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added .
This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return .
You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample .
Rose is a nice , caring girl .
Also the group should use a control in this experiment .
These codons code for specific amino acids .
They also both only eat one thing exclusively panda : bambo & koalas ; eucalyptus leaves .
They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples .
Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag .
His first heading , What Is Space Junk , gives the topic of the following paragraphs .
Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2 .
She is responsible .
First , mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it .
Passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones .
Therefore , Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career .
1 ) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
For example each could be a foot long .
This progression gives the reader a solid grasp of the Space Junk problem .
How much vinegar rinse or how long
He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training ' in reading .
rose is resposible .
The third is called Crash course .
These debris when traveling at five miles per second can cause serious damage to elite spacecrafts .
Also , how much vinegar to pour into each container .
Why could n't they just leave it how it was .
Rose is very understanding of other people .
It is important to have them all be the same size .
Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples .
white : : The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature .
One can see that Rose 's life is very busy .
It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag .
In order to complete this experiment , you would need additional information .
white : : Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler .
Paul greatly appreciated that an old star was helping him with his hurdles now .
He first starts out with an introduction .
Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment .
See both Paul and Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother .
The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis .
Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too .
And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read .
These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment .
How it comes bout .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy .
I need to know how much vinegar .
This means it has more elasticity than the others .
The tRNA brings the amino acids which the mRNA lines up to make a complete protein .
The section titled 'Crash Course ' posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk .
This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow . '
Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane .
They share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them .
leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter dash and broke records .
One way the student could 've improved the experiment is to add another trial .
He does this because he is returning a favor .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
Rose is willing to work for her family because that is tradition that occurs in Cambodia .
I think Paul also felt , that he was n't the only one going through learning diableties .
The author organizes this article in to different columns stating with an intuduction .
^p 2 . )
How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass .
All of this is to help her family .
Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading .
Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard .
I sugest painting the dog house white .
Passive transport does not require energy .
Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane .
I would need to know what to label the containers .
This could help determine which plastic 's better .
This occurs when the cell dose n't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane .
This signals the end of protein synthesis .
Having different sizes might change the results .
Now a python ares n't live off one food , so it can live anywhere and splecd .
'It 's time to start your training . ' .
As well as try half with weights and the other half with none .
They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much .
This section informs the reader that space junk is a serious problem that needs to be addressed .
The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to .
In return , Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
Next to crash course which decribes how the satellites crash noto one another .
`` Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists and only eat one food .
The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits , but a big deal .
Rose cares about others .
The author had three key points that were intended to be explained thoroughly .
Next , what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide ?
`` Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both specialists .
Maybe it would n't .
All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount .
For example , Rose said to Anna , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
It talks about space debree , and how to solve the problem .
They are both different from pythons because they do n't eat meet .
THAT PROVES SHE CARES FOR HER FAMILY AND IS A KIND AND CARING PERSON IT DECRIBES HER .
They could have put the names of the types of plastics .
^p b .
The author gives an example of when one American and Russian satellites ran into each other .
Another problem is that they did n't mention how much vinegar should be used .
When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard , he seemed very suprised .
Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt .
In the first piece of the article , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup .
This makes them similar but different from pythons because pythons eat other animals unlike koalas & pandas .
Students can improve the design by having a control so that they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable .
When he meets Mr. Leonard , Paul becomes motivated by him .
And that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had .
It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in .
No matter how small the junk may be , it can still cause damage .
America is being invaded and steps in stop it need to be taken .
She cares fro Paul .
The author organizes the article according to topic .
being sent into space , and how therefore space trash is increasing .
White would be the best choice for the doghouse .
Paul feels the same way as Mr. Leonard does about not being a good reader .
One trait that Rose possesses is being compasionate towards others .
The phrase , 'Grab your telescope !
The author organizes the article in a 'opening support conclussion ' format .
They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need .
But , it is still dangerous in space .
a .
`` `` A python swallowed n alligator . '' '' ''
At the end the author summarizes the article with a conclusion .
Rose does n't like to hurt anybody .
1 .
The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor .
Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2 .
They gave different statistics about the various parts of space junk , that was addressed .
The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this .
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read He wants to help him .
`` The word `` '' invasive is extremely significant in the understanding of this article .
Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested .
The author organizes the article into four major groups ; the introduction , 'What is Space Junk ?
Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples .
If i Identified on trait it would be that she cares about her family .
Therefore , the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
^p 2 ) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers .
Plastic type B was the most stretchable .
Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing .
'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' this is explaing the danger in these objects orbitting the Earth .
Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard .
is 53 ( DEG ) c if the dog likes it hot in there
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling .
Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane .
^p -In step 4 , how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me . '
Mr. Leonard could never read , yet he broke records in college .
In the last sentence , Paul says , `` C'mon , Mr. Lenoard .
Being a specialist , they do not like change and would rather stick to a more stable environment .
The in the section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he 's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed .
Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup .
He related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud .
The effect it has on paul , is to motivating .
In what unit ( grams ?
The darker the color , the more heat .
Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab .
This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring .
The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type .
paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard , he really felt for him .
So its a just right roof .
Also , he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to .
Lastly , what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment .
The second section is titled , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to .
This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful .
The article says that invasive species are a threat to biodiversity .
Rose has a positive attitude .
There are many ways that the group could have improved their design .
white : : It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature .
Both species rely on specific conditions such as climate and food sources which restrict them from living anywhere else .
After hearing Mr. Leonard 's story , Paul made a mental connection with him .
Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein , this uses energy .
Koala bears in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves which are only found in few parts of the world .
Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals .
It gives me brief information about the article .
Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds .
Pythons are diffrent .
When she finished those tasks , she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion .
Niether of them could read and both good at track .
It does n't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that .
Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least .
This simply increases the respect he has for him .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched .
The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul .
Specialists are different from generalist because generalist are abundant species that often do best in and around humans . ''
Such as the titles 'What is Space Junk ? '
He realizes that they are much a like .
They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed .
Paul is puzzled by the information that he finds .
the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
One trait that describe Rose is that she is a hard worker .
The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by ; 1 .
The student could make sure each test was in same environment .
This leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead ' satellites cause , and so on .
and they could have tested more types of plastics .
I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers .
I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this .
in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm .
Make each plastic the same starting lenth , and the weights are the same weight .
' , explains how disabled satellites can become junk orbiting the earth .
Each section provides important statistics on the topic .
Every week , Paul passes Mr. Leonard , a hall monitor , on his way to remediation .
When translation begins , the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon .
Pandas and koalas are both specialist and need specific things to live .
We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment .
When Mr. Leonard gives Paul some background information on his life , Paul begins to relate to him .
This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane .
With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials .
The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be .
2 .
Then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this 'space junk ' can be .
Also , they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic .
In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar .
Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister , Anna 's life .
Roses ocversation with Anna shows that she is mature .
It helps the validity of the experiment .
Also I would need to know how top measure the mass .
It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
He has felt the same way before and still does in school .
They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and eat a verity of food .
a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b .
I feel that the background information that Paul discovered about Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation .
^p Did a third trial .
Mr. Leonard flunked .
It made him confident that Mr. leonard could make him great .
That would also be helpful .
Pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in China .
After 'Crash Course ' , the next section is titled 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
a ) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap .
Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
Finally , they tell us that this is serious matter and we have to face it .
It talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology .
She does not have much time to do so , and is often too tired to even finish .
You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses .
Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m .
Next is the evidence of the danger 'sapce junk ' can make in 'Crash Course ' .
Koalas , the article states eats eucalyptus almost exclusively .
I would also need the amount trials done .
Pythons are different because they are generalist , meaning they can survive different conditions .
The necessary samples : marble , limestone , wood , and plastic , are not listed in the procedure .
Osmosis : Moving water across the membrane by way of carrier protiens .
black : : the darker the color , the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer .
The two produce a chain of amino acids.4 .
She did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her .
A passive transport uses little or no energy .
We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups .
Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read .
Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each .
Next we have Crash Course , which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites .
he also realizes that those two are very much the same , because they both are n't good at reading
In the final section they explain how the space garbage can cause complications for spacecraft .
^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water ?
By attracting more light , it usually makes things much warmer .
The first section explains the main purpose of the aticle .
a . )
Paul , who also could n't read , felt close to Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes the article by starting with an attention getter .
The second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother .
The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable .
One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used .
Their food source is only found in their home place so adapting to other places would be extremely hard .
They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it .
The different sections the authour uses are 'Orbiting Junk ' as the introduction , 'What is Space Junk ? '
The amino acids form an amino acid chain , which is also called a protein .
^p b ) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials .
The order of the information makes sense in the human mind .
If these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die .
Plastic B was the weakest in both tests .
In order to replicate this experiment , there are a few more things I need to know .
Invasive species may become extinct of the introduced generalists . ''
China 's panda and Australia 's koala bear are similar because they really do n't each much .
The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure .
white : : I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house .
How much sample to add into each solution .
In conclusion , some of the plastics stretched more than others , however all of them did stretch .
When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard , his natural curiosity turns to empathy .
white : : Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint .
Finally it does n't say how long the sample should be rinced for .
According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A .
The first type of movement is called active transport .
This would make the experiment more valid .
a ) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
One trait that can describe Rose would be concern .
a ) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest .
One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group 's procedure .
It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome .
Rose is caring .
Then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened .
However , the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42 ( DEG ) C
The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab .
This membrane is water soluable .
Rose can be described by hopeful .
He says , 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
Invasive in this article used because those animals were never meant to travel from one area of to
The background informations effect on Paul is that it inspires him .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia .
replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation
They had something in common .
The autor organizes the article very well .
At the beginning of the story , Paul is having trouble in school .
The author organizes the article in a way of increasing importance .
Until then , she is doing everything .
Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2 .
I would need to know what the four samples of material are .
The author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories .
The just use thing they know and but things where they belong .
You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it .
and the next section is 'Crash Course ' .
Facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell .
Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length .
Mr. Leonard never had help with reading and he failed college .
First of all they did n't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment .
For example , crocodiles is something they even attempt to eat .
I would need to know how big each individed
in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell .
The students should be more specific in giving the directions well .
A ) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability .
Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard .
Mr. Leonard said , ' I remember , best race of my life . '
He could not read .
Each Subtitle leads into one another very nicely , and does not get uyou confused .
They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup .
Paul did n't understand how he got to college .
Shows why we should be worried .
Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals , Mr. Leonard even broke records .
The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics .
They both had learning problems .
This makes understanding the information easier .
Active Transport : Used to move substances by way of transport protien against the concentration gradient .
He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name .
Paul is not exactly an average boy , he does n't really fit in and he can not read .
^p b . )
These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample .
The plastic type B had stretched the most .
white : : The black was 9 ( DEG ) C warmer then the white colored paint .
He could n't beleive that the an in front of him was a track star .
Pythons eat anything like when `` '' a python swallowed an alligator and ... exploded '' '' .
I see Rose as a caring girl .
The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation .
Anna cares about other people , even when it causes stress for her .
To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for .
We would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each .
Also , adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment .
When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article .
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring .
By putting the articles in there owns subject like 'What Is Space Junk ? .
My conclusion is that type B stretched the most .
After Paul learned all of this information , he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard .
For example , 'What is Space Junk ' and 'Crash Course . '
according to the experiment , us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low .
By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid .
Such as in the sub-headding of 'Crash Course ' , it talks about our satellites colliding with Russia .
Lastly , they do n't give the names or amounts of each sample .
It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone .
'The emotions in Mr. leanard 's words were all to familier to me . '
'Anna , ' Rose said 'Whats wrong ? '
Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not .
The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics . ''
black : : Black will make the doghouse to hot .
A trait Rose has is that she is understanding .
Rose is respectful of her elders and thinks about other people first .
Pythons are an example of invasive species .
Pandas eat bamboo , and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
The author organized the article , 'Orbiting Junk ' by adding different sections of reading .
in that paragraph he explains the meaning of space junk .
He went to college on a scholoarship and broke many school records .
Based on the student 's data , plastic A stretched the least amount .
An example is in paragraph 19 'Rose did n't answer .
and 'are you feeling ok ' ?
I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups .
Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers .
They use facts and even an instance where the colliosions have appeared .
Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school .
Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul , and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension .
Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit .
That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk .
The author organizes the article in a very logical way .
I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard ' .
One way this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents .
The author brakes down the article into sections .
B . )
Based on the students data , the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic .
As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard , he was a hall monitor .
That she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong .
The panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
Find his conclusion .
Plastic A was the least stretchy .
Paul felt sympathic .
4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein .
A specialist can only live in one place where as a generalist can live almost anywhere .
He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic .
And probably her aunt would tell her mom . '
white : : White is a very light color .
This shows that she cares about her family .
`` The group was not very specific in their procedures .
The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have .
Talking about the first launch and the space race in the Cold War .
Each section relates to the main idea , which is that there is waste orbiting in space .
So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read .
Next he then explain his next section 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp .
In the first paragraph , the author mostly explains what space junk is and how it gets there .
Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept .
To be able to replicate this experiment , the group would need to add what each sample is .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard use to be a really good runner , but was bad at reading .
Rose is a very caring person .
`` A0 I conclude that plastic type `` '' B '' '' has the highest amount of stretchability .
The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul .
The author provides facts and opinions in each subtopic to enlighten the reader about space .
The author breaks down the article into three different sections .
With passive transport , the cell wo n't have to use any energy to move the substance .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal talks about how even the smallest items can damaged a space craft .
When she was talking to Anna all she tried to do was cheer her up .
The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star .
Then he tells you what space junk is basically .
Paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards Mr. Leonard .
This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment .
Paul was surprised .
In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A .
Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell .
Thats been training him on the track everyday .
He catches your attention , then gets serious .
Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of .
He plans out the paper very well .
Paul was in school and could n't read .
'It 's time to start your training . ''
white : : The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse .
Pandas only eat bamboo , and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang .
Well , after reading the second paragraph , we know what that is .
It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well .
Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two .
In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm .
Next he talks about collisions in space .
It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container .
You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain .
Mr. Leonard could n't read either and he could n't get very far in his life .
Human and equipment errors as always possible .
Mr. Leonard said , ' I was a good athlete , but not a good student .
black : : The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' had great significance in the article .
Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner .
Lastly , he/she explains why it is a big deal to many people why space junk is dangerous .
4 ) the amino acids bind together into macromolecules called proteins .
Paul also has a hard time in school .
after that , they discuss what happens when two satellites collide .
Also , the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials .
Finally , you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours .
So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color .
Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem .
If she to ; d the truth she would hurt her aunt .
Then they talk about how satellites can collide with each other .
' , to explain what the introduction was about .
Thhe author gives us information on the topic and little history behind it .
The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk ?
Carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell .
The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk .
Next the author explains the danger of the main topic mentioned in the introduction .
Lastly does it matter the material of the container : glass , metal .
Mr. Leonard past effects Paul , since Mr. Leoanrd had spent his own time helping Paul with track .
black : : White would keep the doghouse the coldest ( ar ound 40 ) .
Finally , the temperatures of the room , where the solutions sat , needs to be known .
Rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset .
She did n't answer her aunt because , she did n't want to hurt her .
Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials .
Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down .
The author closes with describing how dangerous space junk is and that people are trying to solve the problem .
They stated four Vinegar in each ... '' '' They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use .
The author talks about satellite crashes and the results of them in the second section .
As long as they are around humans they will survive better .
So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time .
The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA , forming a protein .
The track coach and Paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
Well Paul dose not know how to read that good .
The second is to list the far samples in the procedure .
Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane .
Another information
They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable .
a .
I would need the amount of vinegar of r container .
Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results .
'What is Space Junk ' gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is .
The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul .
So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt , he felt embarresed .
Paul says 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
This means that they can not live in a lot of places .
To improve the experiment , the students could have done more trials to get better observations .
Lastly , plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2 .
She fell asleep while working on her essay .
Following the Introduction is the Body of the article that explains the main idea further .
^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at ?
The passage is written like an essay with an introduction , body , and a conclusion .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala are different from a python because pythons eat other animals .
Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody .
The catagories the author used were 'What is Space Junk ?
And what to use to determine the mass of them .
I knew them well . '
The author organized the article using topic headlines .
What IS Space Junk explains to the readers about what kind of items are left behind in space .
To conclude this experiment .
white : : This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14 .
then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be .
Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be .
Plastic type A has the worst stretchability .
The background information changes Paul 's view on the Mr. Leonard .
They could have specified which plastics they used , not just A , B , c & d. 2 .
And lastly , they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are : what the article calls specialists .
A ) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility .
One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers .
It 's a ... tool bag ? '
Pouring different amonts could change the mass .
The procedure is very vague .
th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42 ( DEG ) C
The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing .
First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers .
Even though he felt embarrassed by the past .
The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide .
No school would take a runner who could n't read .
Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following : ^p 1 .
However , endocytosis is a form of active transport .
Rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was just like him , Mr. Leonard could n't read well either .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane .
That shows that she was working hard enough to make her tired .
On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles .
They then go into a breif description of space flight .
First , their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested .
Lastly , there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container .
Following that , the next catagory is 'Crash Course ' he talks about what could go wrong with satallites .
Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard 's troubles .
A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog .
^p B .
This pertains to the article because one point of view considers the python invasive .
black : : The doghouse will be warmer .
He puts things down by there importance , uses tone of voice , and organizes his thoughts well .
One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials .
The panda and the koala eats only a certain type of food rather than everything .
The author organizes the article by putting side heading into the story .
Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy .
The author begins by creating the introduction , showing the beginning of space exploration .
The difference bettween koalas and pandas is pythons eat meet and above any kind .
Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA .
Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage .
Plastic A is the least strechable .
She does n't like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys .
There is a 11 ( DEG ) difference between the black and white colored lid .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because .
The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves .
Another way to give a hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong .
The author organizes the article using an introduction , two body sections and then a conclusion .
It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble .
The author starts off the article with a catchy introduction .
Leonard ... It 's time to start your training . '
In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm .
It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder .
A ) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all .
A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable .
Yhe job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
Lastly , he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that NASA is looking for a solution .
The adaptability of the python makes it different from koalas and pandas .
This shows a trait of being optimistic .
Like the text says 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic .
Also , she should tell what plastics were used .
They are both vegetarian .
Type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you
The author makes these description in the paragraphs of 'Crash Course . '
The python is an invasive speices to the everglades .
Specialist specie favor stability .
The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar .
Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm , plastic type B is the least change .
Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose .
He then explains in 'Crash Course ' what happens .
A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length .
They should of said how much the clamp weighed .
She also helps out Aunt Kolab .
( b ) .
They are not native to America , and they are invasive because they are taking over the environment .
I would need to know what the samples were .
There is no control in the starting length of the plastics .
Paul did n't know why Mr. Leonard did n't tell everyone that he broke records .
And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
inside jar after 10 min .
He also believes that mankind chose to do what it wants so the species aren 4 invasive .
They could 've put little or a lot .
Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C , D , and B .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records .
How much vinegar you pour into the cups .
It shows Paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life .
Different weights would affect accuracy negatively .
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard did n't mention the fact that he was a college track star .
Learning Mr. Leonard 's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed .
Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched .
In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information .
It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics .
'Little Bits , But a Big Deal , ' describes how truely dangerous these things can be .
Therefore the students should specify the marble , limestone , wood + plastic .
One of Rose 's main traits in the story is her selfless determination .
You would need to know how big of cups to use .
The author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information .
Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability .
What the samples are , what type of containers .
One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant .
Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane , but it does not require energy .
A .
After that , the author finishes up , but without a specific conclusion .
In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm .
Plastic type B was the most stretchiest ( 22 & 23 ) & plastic type A stretched the least .
Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do .
The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track .
Should it be poured limestone , a block of wood etc .
Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics .
The author organizes the article by seperating different subjects under subtitle .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are invasive species .
Next it talks about satellites and how they run the risk of colliding with each oter .
When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard , Paul feels empathetic for him .
The least stretchy would be plastic type A .
For example , 'Crash Course ' explains the colliding of satellites .
It attaches at the first bonding site which matches the complementary codons .
Paul is empathetic towards Mr. Leonard and vice-versa because of their similarites .
She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her .
All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways .
Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees .
Paul is actually lucky .
The effect it had on paul was to want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading ability .
Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals .
An probably her aunt would tell her mother .
They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials .
The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure .
The author organizes the article into three sections , following the introduction .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both bears and have similar diets .
To the lowest te mperature , 41 ( DEG ) C for the color white .
They both like to eat certain food .
Invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area . ''
Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard did n't tell him about how good of an athlete he was .
Every article has a differnet subtitle that explains a differnet subject .
tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand .
Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard when he learns about Mr. Leonard 's background information .
Through this data recorded from the experiment , we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup .
Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both ca n't read .
Finally , they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data .
They should have specified the amount of weight .
Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul .
( Results in the feeling of something ( pain , heat , cold . ) )
The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees .
The pieces are so little but yet so powerful .
white : : the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot .
This experiment needs something to compare to or else the results are not totally valid .
b ) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control .
^p 1 ) Do it again .
He shows how things can fall in to the orbit and show how it can effact the earth .
Marble , limestone , wood , and plastic .
What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used ?
Rose can be described as caring and considerate of others ' feelings .
So Paul felt empathetic and took him to the learning center .
Cell mebranes are semi-permeable .
She is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school , even though she is exhasuted .
A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay .
The length of each plastic shows the same .
paul i surprised at the information , he didnt know that he had been training with a track star .
'Anna , ' Rose said .
^p 2 .
Another process used by cells is cellular diffusion .
They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container .
Right now there is no constant in the experiment .
In paragraph 14 , a python had swallowed an alligator .
He just wants the reader to want to keep reading keep it intersenting .
Before all the information can bore the reader , the author changes the topic to Crash Course .
That is a big deal .
They then move on to overviewing what 'space junk ' consists of , and how it came to be .
He want 's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him .
Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well .
You can not obtain consistancy , a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment , in only two trials .
Towards the end of the story , Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard and his past .
^p B . )
Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment .
It 's a meteor !
Paul is curious as to what happened to his career as a track athlete .
This brings a closeness and a sense of empathy to Paul .
Paul was more than happy to help his new freind .
To replicate the experiment , a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample .
She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family .
In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers .
Rose is caring .
Paul ca n't read and neither could Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes the article into four different sections .
The author is very organized in this article .
I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used .
b . )
The student 's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable .
Then he talks in order of stuff that goes on in outer space .
Lastly , the third section tells the aftermath .
Lastly , you would need to know how much distilled water that you need .
I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf .
These animals are usually thought of as harmful to the environment it lives in .
They start off with an introduction that catches the reader 's eye .
One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP .
Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
Mr. Leonard also helps Paul not feel like an outcast .
I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the four plastics type I tested .
A constant variable was not included .
This causes an unbalance in the ecosystem .
The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein .
I would need to get these items in ahead of time , and have the right things like containers .
Paul knows what its like to not be able to read .
Also they are both good hurdelers .
Second it does n't state what are the samples like what rocks they are .
The author organizes this article 'Orbiting Junk ' into specific sections .
Paul connected Leonard because they both had a hard time reading .
the second was .
In order to replicate the experiment , we would need to know what different samples to use .
Invasive is a negative connotation because invasive species are usually threats to biodiversity .
The reader can see that this information has a great effect on Paul .
My conclusion would be according to the data shown , plastic B has the highest amount being stretched .
He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for .
The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard ; sympathy .
It includes headings with short paragraghes under them .
You broke records .
Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard .
in jar before starting exp .
Paul and both Mr. Leonard ca n't read , but they both excel in jumping hurdles .
When Paul learns Mr. Leonard 's background information he feels connected to him .
The article finishes with a conclusion that outlines space pollution and the issues that can arise because of it .
Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past .
Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunkred out of college simply because he could n't read .
1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2 .
I think panda and koalas was same specie .
Paul has empathy for Mr. Leonard .
2. types of sampling .
One trait described in the story from Rose talking to Anna is caring .
While training with Mr. Leonard , Paul learns more about him and his past .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to use .
So 'Crash Course ' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit .
Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability .
Paul asked him 'why did n't you tell me about this ' .
Then it goes on to tell us about space junk .
Once Paul knew Leonard could n't read that well he decides to teach him as Leonard tought Paul .
`` ( a ) Plastic type `` '' B '' '' is made of the stretchiest material .
She is considerate to others feelings .
In 'What Is Space Junk ' , the author tells us what space junk is .
That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics .
The author first draws the reader in with the introduction .
Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure .
There , it attaches to a ribosome .
The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat .
This shows she is atleast giving it a shot .
After she says that Rose said that that her aunt 's offer had somehow made her feel lighter .
This differs from the python , because unlike pandas & koalas , pythons are carnivores .
'It 's time to start your training . '
They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic .
The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors .
This will continue until it reaches a stop codon .
The author organizes the article in order to create a detailed introduction , explanation , and conclusion .
So its not all in one combination .
Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more .
Another process is using a protein channel .
Pandas and Koalas can not live without specialists . ''
The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard .
a .
This means they are both dependent selective food source .
There are many plots that can support the point , among which one detail is predominant .
Mr. Leonard Girabowski , a track star .
In paragraph one , the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things .
Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration .
Next , he or she defines Space Junk .
Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability .
She is taking a job that conflicts with her school work jsut to help put paul through college .
She worries about her whole family and wants to help make life better for them .
Also , to get better results the student should 've conducted a third trial .
Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability .
It teaches Paul to overcome the tough obsicals in life as Mr. Leonard almost did .
Every week , Mr. Leonard asked the same question - 'Where are you going ? ' .
The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added .
You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of .
Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability .
How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get .
Third , you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal .
3 .
They finally could have said what the starting length should be .
He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him . '
But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard did n't do well in school .
this data states that plastic B was the strongest .
Mr. Leonard broke records but because he didnt have help with reading he failed his classes and flunked out .
^p b .
.
He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals .
The next three paragraphs are organized by the content within them .
Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2 .
They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read .
What kind of containers ? Big small ?
In the procedure , the first step is measuring the length , but i do n't see that data .
The autor begins by getting the readers attention .
This does n't give the readers anything to compare the results .
1 .
a . )
They are specialist and pythons are generalist .
Then the author describes what space junk is .
3.diffusion when
The students can able more trials to their experiments .
So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment .
This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem .
Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside .
'Rose did n't answer .
The python is highly adaptable and can live anywhere with a reasonably favorable climate .
Beaker , test tube , a regular container ?
Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial .
In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
Then there is another title , 'Crash Course ' .
As a opposed to pythons that eat meat .
The narrator is surprised at the information .
Lastly he tells some specific things that have happen in space .
'It 's time to start your training . '
All of the following are to condense the article into areas that focus on those specific ideas .
Paul is inspired by the fact that Mr. Leonard , a great athlete , is training him .
They both ca n't read but both are good at track .
Through this connection , they can both help each other out .
You would need to know what materials to use , the amount of vinegar to use , and .
Based on the student 's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity .
When he found out that Mr. Leonard also could n't read , he understood how his coach felt .
Storing the samples , is another vital area in this experiment .
A ) The stretchiest of the four materials was B , with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm 's .
Based on the data , it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm .
In this , I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person .
Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard , because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed .
'It 's time to start your training . '
Every weight they add should be the same .
If you use more of one sample than another , then of course it is going to way more .
Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they both specialists .
The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane .
The author also uses varies fact throughout the article .
Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were .
The author organizes the article with little articles in it .
A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins .
Paul got a glimpse of his future .
They then go on to tell of the dangers of space junk floating around in space .
One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring .
This section informs the reader on how the debris gets into space and what exactly space junk is .
Such as earth , wood , limestone , and plastic and how much of each to put in .
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shocks him .
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a staggering effect on Paul .
Then , by titleing the section 'What Is Space Junk ?
In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm .
`` a .
Lastly , i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them .
Like When She feel asleep working on her essay .
Also , how much distilled water I would need to use .
During her conversation with Aunt Kolab , Rose does n't tell her how she feels .
He describes many of the passages by showing what can happen .
Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched .
As shown in the data white is the coolest .
It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest .
1 .
Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period .
Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are .
' ) , and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did .
Also by using the same weight to weights .
What is space junk ? , Crash course. , and Little bits , but a big deal .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
When Mr. Leonard explains as to why , Paul was attentive and sympathetic .
How are you going to measure the mass ?
As college life caught up with him , he realized that he could n't do it .
These small pieces can cause damage , because of the rate of speed that they are moving .
Lastly , It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result .
in support for him .
A .
When Anna walks in the room , she immediately asks her what the matter is , 'What 's wrong ?
Look up in the sky !
( 5 ) .
This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time .
In able to complete this experiment .
Rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family .
The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk .
He wants to repay him for all the help Mr. Leonard gave him .
I would need to know how much vinegar to add .
Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard 's track talents .
black : : This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors .
After learning of the background information , Paul feels more connected to Mr. Leonard .
Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes .
Rose is a caring person .
It made Paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend .
Then , the author talks about how dangerous it is when objects in space collide .
The final paragraph reads , ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
He organizes it by topic , such as what is Space Junk ?
Another way is by facilitated diffusion .
The last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be .
So Paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
Rose is trying to be very optimistic during her conversation with Anna .
The sections also make the article easier to navigate and read .
I fell asleep working on my essay , ' Rose said .
One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights .
This tells us pandas ca n't adapt to other places like pythons . ''
Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient .
They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant .
Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass .
In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait .
The author organizes the article into different aspects of 'space junk . '
white : : The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature .
It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star .
'Crash Course ' and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes .
The quote already states pandas and koalas do not like meat . ''
Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read .
The first main section , titled 'What is Space Junk ?
Rose feels as if she is being overwhelmed with everything she has to do .
She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young .
Another would be to make the procedure more understandable .
Another would be how much of the samples ?
The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help .
How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water ?
The Third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane .
We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest .
Maybe her life would get easier .
Also , the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched .
A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m .
And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot .
The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using .
Paragraph 45 states , 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
'He had to go .
I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used .
Throughout the article , until the conclusion , the author says how dangerous and improtant the issues can be .
Pandas can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to even outer space .
Paul was suprised that someone that good was teaching to him to succeed like Mr.Leonard did .
^p 2 .
In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated .
You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers .
He understands why he was helping him out with the hurdles .
Rose is caring .
In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble , limestone , wood , and plastic .
Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment .
Rose did n't answer .
If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results .
That is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment .
It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others .
Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment .
In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12 .
He can not read , and struggles with his homework .
I.e Hence the term `` '' invasive . '' '' ''
Paul felt closer to Mr. Leonard because they had the same emotions .
He then goes on to explain what 'space junk ' is .
Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Then in the section 'What Is Space Junk ?
He begins by using an introduction that will get the attention of the reader .
the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog .
They are different from pythons .
So the trait that identified in the passage is that she caring .
If placed indoors , the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm .
You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add .
Climats , making it difficult to survive in a variety of areas .
The catagories use were , 'What Is Space Junk ?
Without these , I could not replicate this experiment .
He organizes it by putting in a certain order .
The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic .
She wants her family to be well of and live a good life .
But he is honored to be coached by him .
Also , make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic .
Last , the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change .
A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain .
Paul understands exactly how Mr. Leonard feels , 'embarrassed . '
You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon .
The author organizes this article into sections with titles with an opening paragraph to grab the readers attention .
white : : This color will cool down the dog house .
Neither of them can read and they are both good at sports .
They helped eachother out .
It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container .
First , he starts with the introduction .
Finally , the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something .
He knew them well .
None of the other plastics had stretched as much .
This show how he felt the need to return the help .
Rose said to Anna .
She always , no matter what situation she is going through , is hopeful .
I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container .
Determine the mass of four samples of what ?
There fore it is hard for them to live in any other and find or environmental .
Pythons can eat anything , as long as they 're living in an environment that is suitable for them .
You feel okay ? '
In her conversation with Anna she says , 'We have do to our part to help Paul finish college .
^p b . )
Then the author explains what space junk really is and how things become space junk .
the first section is the introduction .
In order to replicate the experiment , i would need some additional information .
That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid.4 .
After that the author explpains the threat of microderis fields and the effects they can have on space missions .
Pythons on the other hand are generalists , and can adapt to change easily .
He was suprised .
Paul wanted to do something for Mr. Leonard because he helped him with hurdles .
The protein channels allow certain things to come through .
How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample ?
but he was a really good athlete .
I would need to also know which type of container to use .
The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA .
It changed by 2mm .
Then , the mRNA enters a ribosome .
Followed by B , D , C .
Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials .
Rose is very caring about her family .
The author organizes this article by splitting the topics up .
This section tells the reader , in detail , or how dangerous space junk can be .
After that is was time to do homework . '
The author then goes into detail about launching the first satellite .
'Rose did n't answer .
Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers .
The white ja r was and average of 42 ( DEG ) after ten minutes .
One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container .
white : : The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool .
The procedure given does n't have enough information so that someone could replicate it .
Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father .
the diffentcies would be 11 ( DEG ) .
Then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs .
rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed .
I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found .
I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic .
We also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space .
The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated .
Paul helped Mr. Leonard , just like he had helped Paul .
So would need to place something in regular water as well .
I need to know what the four starting samples are .
of the room , i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used .
Based on the students data , Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm .
I say this because in trial 1 , it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm .
The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport , also .
He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college .
The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4 .
It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm .
Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure .
Lastly , he concluds by proposing a sollution to this problem .
After the coach explained himself , paul knew how he had felt , him being in the same situation .
Each section has a header indentifying it .
This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close .
In the article it said that a python went into the everglades and swallowed an alligator .
The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores .
This statement , made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally .
Facilitated Diffusion : The passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy , working against the gradient.3 .
Paul finds this to be surprising .
You feel okay ? '
Because Mr. Leonard flunked , he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed .
`` `` Determine the mass of four different samples '' '' .
In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information .
Invasive species are animals that are introduced into an envoriment and thrive in it possible affecting other animals .
Meanwhile , there are pythons exploding because they try to eat alligators .
Diffusion , movement from high to low concentration .
Based on the students data you ca n't really come to a conclusion because there is n't enough data .
One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container .
The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed ?
The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table .
One major type of cellular movement is passive transport .
It stretched 22mm in trial one , and 23 mm in trial 2 .
The author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts .
white : : It would make it cooler than the other colors .
They could 've said the weight of the weights are used .
Then Mr.Leonard explains everything .
The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2 .
' , is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris .
In this experiment , students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability .
^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length .
You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers .
Paul can see himself through Mr. Leonard .
He not only overcomes his inability to read , but finds an outlet , and takes leadership in both .
dark gray : : It will be warm inside the doghouse , but not too warm .
When the coach writes down the URL for the Track website when Paul gets home he checks it out .
I think Paul is shocked too find out that Mr. Leonard broke records .
The author has three sections in his article .
The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him of working harder .
and he got an unexpected answer .
The first section tells us about the space invasion and about general space junk .
So if the roof is white the dog will too cool .
According to the students data , type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest .
Invasive species are nonnative species that are introduced to an environment and will eat indigenous species .
I order of the stretchiest would be B , D , C , and A .
the author expalins what the 'junk ' is that is orbiting .
In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know what samples they used .
That shows it has the most durability for stretching .
The darker the lid , the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat .
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking .
What temperature was the room at to make it dry .
^p b .
2 .
And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar .
The panda and koala differ from pythons because pythons eat mostly other animal .
A panda in China and koala from Australia are both similar because they mainly eat one food .
Plastic type `` '' A '' '' has the worst stretchability .
^p + Temperature affects evaporation .
Paul finds out , like him , Mr. Leonard can not read but can run track .
Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one .
he didnt know that Mr. Leonard was that great of an athlete .
The word invasive pertains to the rest of the article in that it is describing the animals .
He even asks Mr. Leonard why he did n't tell Paul .
They differ from pythons because pythons eat rats and other animals .
Therefore , it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams .
I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results .
If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily .
The author organizes this article very well and it 's easier to understand .
He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either .
When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader , he realizes they are alike .
3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds .
The author organizes in a good way , by using sections .
He finds that Mr. Leonard used to be on the track team when he was in college .
Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is .
Pythons are generalists which can live anywhere because they adapt .
Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for ?
MacInnes , however , says that calling these species `` '' invasive '' '' is passing judgement . '' ''
He can relate to him in the way that he ca n't read very well .
Cells also use passive and active transport .
The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing , and is still a problem .
A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment .
One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart .
For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described .
The students need to be more specific on their materials .
Based on the student 's data , you can conclude that plastic A streched the most .
In the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo .
Plastic type C and D are in the midle .
Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul .
Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics .
a .
Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar .
The author organizes the article in sections .
In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling .
Also , I would need to know what material to put in each container .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , but a Big Deal ' .
He could have also included the weights of the weights he added .
You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use .
Endocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to transport large substances into the cell .
So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to .
Then in the next two sections he goes into greater detail about how it 's a problem .
Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him .
Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through .
The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps .
Mr. Leonard makes Paul run laps , while hurdling .
Finally they going into different section of how space junk is dangerous .
In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample .
This student only had two trials instead of three .
He reailzed that he was in the same position as Mr. Leonard .
And also , you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids .
It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence .
Third they tell you what can happen with all the space junk .
Repeat trials again ( 3rd time ) .
The panda and koala are different from a python because they are specialists and a python is a generalist .
Yet both of these animals are extremly different from a python .
If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties .
The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be .
Mr. Leonard too could not read .
The additional information that should be included in this procedure is .
There similar because most species are abundant and they do very good around humans .
Conclusively plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples .
Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on .
The third process is the permeability of the cell .
She is caring for her sister .
Plastic type B was the stretchiest , while A stretched the least .
He was very happy for him .
' , meaning he wants to help him learn how to read .
In his introduction he starts off with some surprising statements such as in lines 1and 2 .
And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample .
The author organizes the article by using catchy phrases and useful information to better understand the subject .
Active transport requires the cell 's energy and exports things out of the membrane .
so white
The Chinese panda and the Australian koala are two specialist species .
First , the author starts out with what the article is going to be about .
In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest .
Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same .
They are more like people in they way that they will eat anything that comes across there path .
The 'lifespan ' of debris , so to say .
Lastely it talks about how loosing space trash is serious matter .
The author puts Orbiting Junk in to sections to show What Is Space Junk .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist .
The author organizes the article but using sub titles and paragraphs .
Then the author talks about how in space it 's really not that safe .
Its a comet !
They give more facts and number that we can not ignore .
Finall , the author tells of ways to prevent the space junk .
^p ( 3 ) Add another 3 trials with different weight .
They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled .
iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest .
You feel okay ? '
`` `` You could concavely have pythons sneaking their way up the Potomac . '' ''
He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records .
In the experiment the results show that the darker the color , the warmer it is inside .
The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size .
She listened to Anna and helped her get over her bad dream .
It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris , it 's ANY object .
Rose can be described as consoling .
After , he explains what happens in space with all the different satelites and how dangerous they can be .
Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well .
And at last have more trials .
Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money .
It also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard .
'Rose did n't answer .
The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length .
They organize the article into sections that are important and give explanation .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein .
I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container .
Paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about Mr. Leonard .
The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit .
I would need to know how much vinegar they used .
It 's a meteor ! '
Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers .
a ) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched .
^p B .
a ) Plastic type B is the strechiest .
The author seperates this article into 4 sections .
and he knew thats Mr.leonard was trying to make him succeed unlike he did .
The author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily , without much confusion .
a .
Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm .
The darker the color of something , the more heat the object absorbs .
When he asks Mr. Leonard , 'What happened after that ? '
Also , in the article the author says pythons were often kept as house pets .
Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed .
The author organizes the article by using headings .
The group 's procedure is missing a couple of elements .
The author organize his article in sections according to the topic .
She says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
Paul could easily relate to Mr. Leonard .
He felt familiar with the feelings .
Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data .
you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water .
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that Paul has in life .
To replicate the experiment , the first thing that a group would need is a control variable .
In the story I obtained information about Mr. Leonard .
The student could have included how much the weights weighed .
The organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader .
Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane .
Also , this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched , not how far they stretch .
Then he goes into what space trash and space junk is .
a .
Mr. Leonards background information greatly influences Paul .
For example one section is 'What is Space Junk ? '
This happens continuously to make proteins .
Then , they talk about various forms of space debris .
To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use .
Both differ from the Pythons , Who snacks on rodents , birds , and the occasional alligator .
Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration .
The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer .
She is caring .
Where do the samples go to sit and dry at .
Then it tells you how satellites crash in space .
Rose is very diligent .
The author organizes the article into sections .
First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container .
What sample ?
Then he explains what makes the 'Space Junk . '
Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most .
They 're relatively harmless and are specialists .
This process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy .
Paul knew how Mr. Leonard felt because he too could not read .
With the data recorded .
What is Space Junk ?
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material .
^p b 1 . )
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard broke high school records in field and track .
A ) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length .
There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white .
B .
Mr. Leonard did n't tell Paul because he could n't read and flunked out of college .
You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results .
10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm .
However , Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he could n't read .
He then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk .
He follows up with a section called 'What Is Space Junk ? '
For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable .
Each section is seperate different subjects .
She is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members .
The author organizes the article with main points about space junk .
The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way .
and Crash course .
This method makes it easy to find important information about a certain topic .
We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
They need to include marble , limestone , wood and plastic into the first step .
Both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read .
Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell .
The section Crash Course refers to the event of a Russian and American satellite 'running ' into one another .
The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length .
Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt 's feelings .
It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment .
Rose cares deeply for her sister .
`` Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both only eat one thing .
The author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk .
Mr. Leonard 's background effects Paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self .
It 's a comet !
Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete .
Paul can sympathize with Mr. Leonard .
The author organizes his articles into sections .
black : : this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer .
Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less .
To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you 're using .
Next they talk about how the debris free-orbiting the eart can cause collisions with other debris .
The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest .
white : : Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house .
^p b . )
in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color .
'What Is Space Junk ?
At least she feels responsible for everyone .
It ends in a conclussion paragraph .
Also , they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2 .
What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use .
One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length .
Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair .
She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding .
One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials .
They are both different from pythons because pythons can swallow an alligator .
It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard .
1 .
The article is organized by the author into sections .
Rose feels grateful after talking to her Aunt Kolab .
The procedure should include what the four different samples are .
Paul sympathizes with him because he has a hard time reading too .
Rose is dedicated to her family .
One trait that can describe Rose is optimistic .
The have differently adapting to all other habitats but their own .
The author writes about Earth 's satellites , how they get there , and what they do .
Paul has difficulty reading as well , and he was always chosen last for sports .
This is how they could improve .
it stretched 2mm more in T2 .
First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are .
These two species differ from a python because a python is a generalist .
^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couid n't properly replicate the experiment .
In fact the comparison is nothing alike .
Then , he helps Paul learn the hurdles , and Paul begins to like him .
This shows risks and what could happen .
He talks about three very important probles in space .
She does n't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet .
it tells us some starter facts and other things .
Panda bears eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2 .
One trait that Rose shows is compasion .
Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm .
First , you would need to know what samples are going in the cup .
One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment .
But not how much vinegar was put into the containers .
^p b . )
The dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) C , w hich might be too hot .
Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability .
A trait that describes Rosa is caring .
First , you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container .
One trait that describes Rose is caring .
He sees that he has become quite the athlete , just like Mr. Leonard .
Its diet changes according to its surrounding food sources .
Rose says to Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
The article is a well organized piece .
The author organizes this article intofour smaller articles that all have an overlying topic that is 'space junk ' .
The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him .
a ) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A , C & D when weights are added to it .
He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well , what happened after that ? ' .
One would be to say how large each sample should be .
2 .
A trait I can identify from Rose 's conversations is that she cares about people in her famil .
It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal .
He breaks it down into different topics .
The student should have done more than 2 trials .
Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something .
The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D , which stretched to 20mm both times .
The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results .
Mr. Leonard then says he was n't a good student and his running career was ended because of it .
black : : I think black would be the best color for the doghouse .
It would help to know how large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount .
Finally , they state why 'space junk ' is such a problem .
The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard .
Just like Mr. Leonard Helped Paul with his training for Track .
Endocytosis and exocytosis are used to control the what substances enter and leave through the plasma membrane .
Anna does n't understand why their father has to be away in Los Angeles .
It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed .
They do n't have a control to show how the others were affected .
Rose asks how Anna feels , she would not ask this unless she cares about her .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in .
And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers .
This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader .
A python eats other animals and pandas and koalas eat plants .
One trait Rose shows is caring .
I would state that plastic B stretched the most .
( 2 ) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers .
She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away .
The effect that Mr. Leonard 's background information has on Paul is he can relate to him .
But after he explained about hies past to Paul .
The given procedure does n't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers .
While speaking to Anna , Rose displays this specific character trait .
If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid .
With the first main point , he asks , 'What is Space Junk ? '
Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard , and decided to help him read .
As a conclusion to the data shown on the table , plastic B had the most stretchability .
When the reader gets the background information about Mr. Leonard , Paul was surprised .
Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest .
A cell uses diffusion , osmosis , and transportation .
She cares about others .
The author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections .
Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B .
which is a centered post or any experiment .
We had no learning centers in our school .
Last , the tRNA shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another .
In knowing Mr. Leonard 's background information , Paul feels like the two can relate now .
Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights . ''
One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment .
Paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete .
He was once a young boy , and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have .
Then the complimentary tRNA , with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand .
As shown in paragraph 15 .
'It 's time too start you training . '
How much vineger do you have to pour into each container .
According to the articles they each have specific diets .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring .
In addition , one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample .
However , it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell .
He/she also explains , 'Yet the problem is certain to persist . '
When she talked to her Aunt Kolab , it had said 'Maybe her life would get easier . '
Goggle inclusion would also be rise .
The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him .
In conclusion , scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched .
I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic .
Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer .
The author organizes the article into different sections that fall under the appropriate headings .
During the story , the readers gets backround information about Mr. Leonard .
Next , we move on to What Is Space Junk , which explains the history of space exploration .
Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in .
^p B .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was also a track star , and he is in amaze .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
A python will eat anything .
Rose is very caring towards her family .
Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things .
That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out .
The pandas eat bamboo and the koala bear eats only eucalyptus leaves .
A ) The conclusion isthat , plastic type B has more stretchability than the others .
The introduction grabs the readers ' attention about the issue .
These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid .
So 25 to make the experiment uniform .
Different tempuratures might affect the different samples .
^p 3 ) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass .
`` `` What favors specialist is stability . '' ''
At the end of the stroy , Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training .
There is also no indication when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples .
Plastic type be was the most stretchable .
Next he explains what space junk is .
The background information Paul found out on Mr. Leonard were familiar to him .
' ( Build up ) .
In this section , the author gives major events about space junk and what creates space junk .
^p Improve : ( 1 ) .
The author organizes the article with an introduction , and three body paragraphs .
The effect that background information Paul has about Mr. Leonard is astonishes Paul greatly .
It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too .
The article contrasts between two opinions on calling species like foreign snakes `` '' invasive . '' ''
Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment .
Lastly , i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment .
Plastic A stretched the most with two mm .
As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The plastic starting length , weights added , and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials .
Juggling the two is very stressful at times .
The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something .
Underneath the title 'What Is Space Junk , ' he familiarizes you with what exactly space junk is .
Finally , the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem .
With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment .
This paragraph defines Space Junk and explains how it is formed .
Also , the trial should be performed more than 2 times .
Mr. Leonard did n't have learning centers , Paul realized how blessed he really was .
To replicate the groups procedure , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container .
' , 'Crash Course ' , 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
A ) Based on the data , plastic B was the most strethible plastic .
The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change .
The highes t temperature was 53 ( DEG ) for the black lid .
Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants .
) The types of samples used should be in the procedure .
It uses no energy because it still diffusion .
I do not , however , believe these results are valid .
It 's a plane !
The author puts the information , into specificly titled sections , which makes this a very organized passage .
Pandas from China and koalas from Australia are both specialists .
Generalists like change and can live almost everywhere .
This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy .
In the conversation Rose was having with Anna , she was trying to reassure her sister .
After reading the groups procedure , there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment .
A .
a .
He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him .
3 .
Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials .
Mr. Leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read .
Mr.Leonard had trouble reading and end up losing his scholarship and flunked out of college .
On the other hand a python is a generalist .
This makes them a very effective invasive species , as described in the article .
Then , he explain more clearly about 'space junk ' in the 'What Is Space Junk ' .
Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both animals do best around humans .
Afterwards , the author explains that space junk can collide into one another .
Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much .
You would need to know what the four different samples are .
Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability .
You can tell that she cares about her little sister .
The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk , circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit . '
But was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard never could read .
All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment . ''
First , the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers .
After hearing Mr. Leonard 's story , he felt as though he should give back .
The only thing he was good at was track .
Also , there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end .
In 'Crash Course ' , the author elaborates on space junk , including a specific example .
Secondly , they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results .
And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk .
All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment .
^p 3 .
Sections are clearly separate from one another .
white : : The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors .
He follows this up by giving us a brief history of space junk .
1 .
gives you a better idea for what it space junk is .
So durin g the summer , the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house .
He explains what he is talking about by saying he sees some space junk in the sky .
^p b .
'It 's time to start your training . '
On the other hand a python can eat many different things and has many more options .
^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics . ''
You know that he surprised because , he confronts him about it .
Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades .
Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy .
I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours .
I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used .
Mr. Leonard wamted the narrator to succeed because of what happened to himself .
They are different because pythons eat all different types of food .
Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type `` '' A it stretched 2mm '' '' .
Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample .
in order to help support the family .
This makes them different from the python because the python eats a wide range of thins . ''
First , I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container .
What containers do I put them in ?
Black had an average of 53 ( DEG ) , whereas whi te had only 42 ( DEG ) .
We worry about panda bears , what about the other animals . ''
The author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading .
But then when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading .
The amino acids are bonded together to make proteins .
The length of the plastic samples should also be the same .
According to the article , pandas & Koalas are specialists who differ from pythons who are generalists .
He is also curious on why he didnt finish college .
Rose is trying to be optimistic about the situation even though she does not feel it .
Then they get let down because the 'comet ' is n't a comet , it 's a tool bag .
The group was n't very specific , for example they did n't say what temp .
The section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard was familiar .
You would also need to know what the materials are that you 're putting into containers .
Mr. Leonard was fanstatic at hurdles in college and was going to go very far in that world .
Based on the students data , plastic B stretches more than the other plastics .
This creates hundreds of microsatellites , otherwise known as debris .
When he confronted Mr. Leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce .
The code AUG means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis .
Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup .
.
Just like any other story should start out as .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader just as Paul is .
He is going to teach him how to read .
^p B ) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed .
They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists .
1 ) You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at .
It also makes him feel like he can acheive things , that he did n't know he could .
Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college .
Paul undersands now why Mr. Leonard pushed him to reach his goal .
Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading .
It 's a ... tool bag ? '
black : : Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors .
Rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like Mama .
The author organizes the article in four basic tones .
For the lowest color , white , it was 42 degrees celcius .
Mr. Leonard was a very poor reader and he failed college .
Paragraph 19- Rose did n't answer .
white : : Darker colors usually attract more light .
They are both different from pythons because pythons eat many of things .
Whe he does , he discovers that Mr. Leonard was just like him .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track .
^p They also should indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample .
' , the author writes about what he/she will be explaining .
Therefore , this article is neatly organized in 4 different sections .
Unlike pandas and koala bears .
So , he was going to teach him how to read .
rRNA inteprates the codons and the ribosome makes amino acids4 .
Paul is happy an shocked at the same time .
He begins with Space Junk which tells about junk and satellites .
1 .
Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul .
He also tells us how an asronaut lost his tool bag in space .
He starts off with a great introduction that has the ability to catch the reader 's attention .
The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first .
It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space .
I agree that 'space junk ' could become a big problem .
You would need a sample of each of the substances .
One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis .
The tone is switched to a more serious one and talks about how the space junk is dangerous .
Instead , you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity .
In order to replicate the group 's procedure I would need some more information .
The paragraphs are titled by what it is going to tell you .
^p 2 .
Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar .
This information encouraged Paul to strive in learning to read .
Paul first wants to know why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about it .
They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container .
`` China 's panda and Australia 's koala are similar because they eat the same thing constintly .
Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else .
`` Both China 's panda and Australia 's Koala bear are both specialists .
One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar .
Secondly , tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome .
Mr. Leonard was a fantastic hurdler but not is n't very studious .
Also , they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers .
Mr. Leonard could n't read and neither can Paul .
Look up in the sky !
And if it should be the same amount in all .
For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic .
^p They should have had a control , atrial where no weights were added .
I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by eating plants & only plants .
One trait that Rose displays in her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is selfless .
In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was capable stretching the most .
Plastic type B stretched the most of all .
This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection .
The author organizes the artical into groups .
Rose is described as motherly and realistic in her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab .
In conclusion .
Without these 3 main information points , nobody could replicate this lab .
You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup .
In the second step how much vinegar should be poured .
Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read .
First , it does n't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers .
Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades .
4 .
Paul is very thankful towards Mr. Leonard for helping him get faster .
Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane .
Pandas from China and koala from Australia both eat almost nothing but one particular thing .
The effect that has on Paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards Mr. Leonard .
Cells also use osmosis , where water moves froman area of lower concentration to an rea of high concentration .
^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material ?
paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard 's words , they were all to familiar to Paul .
Rose is very caring .
^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge .
Based on the student 's data , plastic B stretched more .
Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials .
He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought .
The author organize 's the article with different titles to represent what they are talking about .
^p -In step 6 , it should say to correct the new mass of each sample .
How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not .
This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment .
They can only be found in certain places where their food supply is .
I have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place .
They rinsed each sample with distilled water .
This meaning that the first section titled 'What is Space Junk ? '
Before certain paragraphs , at the left-hand side is a bolded subtitle .
The python has a wider range of habitat and a less specific lifestyle .
The author ends the article giving his or hers opinion about what the artivle is discussing .
During the story .
light gray : : This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature .
The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least .
One trait that describes Rose is respectful .
However , the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results .
After reading the procedure some things are still unclear .
Determined , she sticks to what is important to her .
Finally , the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry .
I would also need to know what the samples are .
And the last paragraph 'Little Bits But a Big Deal ' explains why space debris is so important .
Rose explains to Anna , without grief , that what they are doing is the best for the family .
The article deals whether or not this is true of this case .
Active Transport is one of the three .
Paul is very surprised to see that he was once a great track star and also struggled with reading .
Invasive is word that means some thing or someone is intruding on an enviroment , and harming it .
Paul grabbed Mr. Leonards hand and told him now its time for your training .
Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to be added to each ,
Also , you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water .
That is an 11 ( DEG ) difference .
In the beginning , he has a very good introduction that actually draws a reader into the story .
One trait that can identify Rose is hopeful .
The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment .
Who cant read and flunks out of college , but amazing at track and had scholarships .
Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane .
When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein .
Second , the procedure did not specify how big each samples should be .
`` These students procedure was not a reliable one .
^p 2 .
Obviously , it is convenient to read under the four headings presented within this article .
He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out .
For example , step 1 should say : `` '' Take 5cm of one plastic type . '' ''
The
Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life .
which shows that she does n't want to see her aunt get hurt .
The Author organizes the article into three sections .
He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard 's kindness , but fails to see Mr. Leonard 's motives .
For example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009 .
What temp is everything ?
This is a conclusion that can be drawn .
He did n't know how to read .
When he did , he found out that Mr. Leonard could n't read .
I would also need to know what sample goes in each container .
^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2 .
Also , they should 've made sure they used the same weights .
is clearly going to talk about what space junk is .
One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure .
The background information help him connect with Mr. Leonard on a whole new level .
Therefore , one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful .
A trait that Rose haswould be hope .
She did not want to desappoint them but she was too stressed to work all the time .
Also the amount of vinegar they used .
Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient , without the need for energy .
Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story .
The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic .
She very worried for the family and that is why she says 'What 's wrong ?
Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used .
Rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school .
Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis .
I would also need to know how big each sample should be .
Lastly the effect that they are both helping each other .
He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read .
What is space junk ?
The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well .
We know this because in paragraph 4-6 , Rose is very concerned about the well-being of her younger sister .
^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers .
This experiment is not valid because the number of weights is n't given .
^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length .
He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment .
They both ca n't read but are willing to try and get better at anything .
The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial .
^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length .
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star he wonders why he is n't anymore .
Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm .
^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial .
Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure .
( a ) The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm .
Rose 's aunt asks her if she felt weighed down .
He uses two example .
Next , tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein .
The author organize the article by using headings that tell what the section will be about .
She is caring .
Determine an amount of vinegar .
Paul becomes curious as to why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him .
The author uses 'cause and effect ' to organize the article .
Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school .
Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials .
She did n't tell her aunt how she fell because she did n't want to hurt her feelings .
You broke records . '
Well , the strongest effect that website about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was shock and suprise .
The group will need to put to the following information .
New proteins are made .
I think that Mr. Leonards ' background information has a big effect on Paul .
'It 's time to start your training . '
The chain of amino acids create a protein .
^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well .
You 'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used .
You can not replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use .
She does n't want to tell her aunt because she might tell her mother or hurt her aunt .
It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space .
They give examples about this topic .
Mr. Leonard had flunked out of school , and lost his scholarship .
Second He or she talks about the satellites crashing .
Second , you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome .
These include ; What Is Space Junk , Crash Course , and Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could n't read .
The author explains what space junk is , and how it is formed .
black : : Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer .
This background information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him .
Diffusion-molecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration.3 .
defines the subject to the reader so that they fully understand the article .
As the tRNA attaches to the mRNA , the amino acids above them form peptide bonds .
they are both different from the python by the python eat other animals and animal populations begin to dwindle .
He is unable to read but is a good at running track .
Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present .
Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane .
It 's a comet !
The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A .
He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read , just like Paul .
Rose is very thankful .
Mr. Leonard 's story has a powerful effect on Paul .
Determine what type of containers are being used .
He was a very gifted athlete .
Then 'Crash Course ' , tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother .
Lastly , I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with .
More information would be needed to replicate the experiment .
Koalas and pandas are both specialist species .
Mr. Leonards says , ' I lost my scholarship and flunnked out . '
In the passage Rose says , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
I would also need to know what type of container .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialist species .
But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm .
In space , even tiny particles will cause some major damage .
The third section descirbes a specific event that led to space junk .
The author organizes the article by breaking it up into sections .
Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm .
The one trait I think that describes rose is , that she is caring .
Should it be the same or different .
One trait is caring .
This is obvious because if the author didnt give you the 'What Is Space junk ? '
The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability .
Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm .
For example , should they be left covered or not ?
These substances move from high concentration to low concentration .
This way it will have more time to stretch . ''
Rose said , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
Lastly , they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking .
'Crash Course ' , tells people about some crashes that have happened while in space .
what material ?
Then he goes into the past , giving the reader a sense of history .
The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least .
I would also need to know what I am measuring the mass in , grams , etc .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
The author organizes the article by what the catergories are .
She cares for her family .
Things such as temperature are necessary .
Immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what 'space junk ' is .
One process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis .
he/ she talks about space junk and how it effects our admisphere and the rocketships in space .
A ) In conclusion , plastic B had the most stretchability .
Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis , Diffusion , and Active Transport .
black : : The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside .
It affects Paul in two ways .
One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3 .
If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated .
In paragraph 19 it says , 'Rose did n't answer .
Lastly , plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm .
Secondly , how large should the samples be ?
They used many facts that really impact the readers knowledge about this space junk .
Paul is inspired by the information about Mr. Loenard because he to has a reading disability .
He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard .
The author organizes the article by putting it in sections that are related to eachother .
Within these groups are the information in an orginised mannor .
The way the procedure is written now we do n't know if the amount of weight was used constant .
In the story Gifts , Paul finds out information about Mr. Leonard that he never told him .
white : : The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re .
First , I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass .
Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure .
if I were Paul I would be honored that a former track star was willing to work with me .
These 3 changes to the procedure , will make the experiment easy for replicate .
Also , the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction .
As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome .
The author also continues to use headings to demonstrate diferent parts of the article .
The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk . '
Because maybe the put or did different procesure .
a ) Plastic type B was the stretchiest , and plastic type A was least stretchiest .
^P B ) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer .
Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g .
Also , plastic type A is the least flexible .
It also means that while breeding , these pythons are attacking and endangering the native wildlife .
After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past .
a ) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types .
When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds .
In the first section the auther explains what space junk is and how it got into space .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
In 2005 a python swallowed an alligator .
After reading the groups procedure , a few things are missing .
For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes .
The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment .
He decides to help Mr. Leonard overcome his obstacles just as he did Paul 's .
In T1 it Stretched 22 mm , and in T2 it stretched 23mm .
Active transport is also used .
I believe it makes paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard is .
Paul struggled reading , and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track .
We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container .
We need to work at things we think we ca n't do .
These include passive/active transport , facilitated diffusion , and osmosis .
b ) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched .
The very last section states that even small bits of space debris can cause a big problem .
Also , they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy .
When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay .
Mr.Leonard relied on his friends to help him get by .
a ) Based on the student data , plastic B is the most stretchable .
it makes Paul feel like he can accomplish what Mr. Leonard never had the opportunity to .
After that , in the the section afer the introduction the author tells how space junk has come about .
Also adding a control would be helpful as well .
Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B .
The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk ?
The author organizes the article by putting a title on each different matter that they are addressing .
The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm .
It 's a meteor !
The second one , being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs .
They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them .
^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic .
Then , the author tells how the space junk actually gets where it is .
One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials .
Rose is understandable .
`` Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both `` '' specialists .
^p B .
balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic .
Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house .
The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases .
In paragraph 19 it reveals Anna didnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolabs feelings .
It 's a comet !
Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other .
The author ends by explaining how space junk poses a big problem .
Dark gray had an average of 48 ( DEG ) .
Doing more trials to collect more data .
Their both different from pythons because pandas and koalas are both furry and pythons have scales on them .
' ( paragraph 40 ) .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring .
According to Paul , 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something ' .
They should have also told us what type of container to use .
These sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read .
Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels .
According to the student 's data plastic type B was able to stretch the longest with 23mm .
They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length .
^p b .
The author organizes this article into four main parts 'Orbiting Junk ' , 'What Is Space Junk ?
Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration , to an area of low concentration .
Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle .
According to the student 's data , plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types .
I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were .
Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two .
Koalas on eucalyptus .
Based
Next , the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk .
The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples .
Diffusion is also one , during diffusion a substance moves from high to low concertration .
This relates to Paul because he ca n't read that well .
It would also put what effect of materials its going to use .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading .
In paragraph 19 , it shows Rose thinking of others before herself .
He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records .
^p b .
Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo , so they are not harmful .
The background information had a major effect on Paul .
assuring , 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college .
These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design .
This inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read .
In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial .
white : : I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials .
^p b ) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added .
One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring .
white : : If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun .
^p b ) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type .
^p 3 ) And they should make sure they have the same size of each material .
Unlike the python which they dont have a problem with migrating and adapting in other environments .
You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant .
This shows compation and caring .
Last , i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours .
Also to have the same weights of each plastic .
There is the introduction , followed by the three subtitles : 'What Is Space Junk ?
The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand .
Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container .
Paul finding out that Mr. Leonard could not read has a very strong affect .
Look up in the sky !
You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment .
One trait that best describes Rose is responsiable .
She does n't answer truthfully , so they do n't know how hard all of it is on her .
He then wants to coach Mr. Leonard in reading like Mr. Leonard coached him in track .
Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted .
Without any of the background information , none of this would have happened .
Next , the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides .
Her aunt tells her that she will try to do something to make her load easier .
You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers .
It 's time to start your training . '
^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials .
However the lid was also a bit warm .
Paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is Mr. Leonard .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic .
This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you .
If pandas or koalas are taken out of their natural habitat , they will most likely not survive .
Mr. Leonard explains that he did n't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now .
Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm .
Even though things are hard for her right now she is n't giving up on things .
In 'What Is Space Junk ' , it described what space junk actually is .
( Were the samples completely covered ? )
The group will need
`` To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample .
Paul wanted to know why Mr. Leonard would want to keep such accomplishments a secret .
He organize his article in the way he is talking about what is Space Junk ?
The background information given allows Paul to connect to Mr. Leonard .
Also , seeing their similarities motivated Paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles .
I mean he had some because he never cried and complained , and Mr. Leonard reached out to him .
Plus if it is a cold winter , t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer .
Plastic type B , which stretched the longest , could have had more weight on it than the others .
One thing is the amount of vinegar used .
In this experiment , the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure .
Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing .
white : : the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler .
The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested .
Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency .
Rose is obviously an optomistic person .
They can adapt to many surroundings and foods .
A ) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1 .
This is a typw of active transport .
Light ?
They are invading southern territory and knocking out endangered species , such as the key largo wood rat .
Secondly , in step two , I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
They could have also added what to measure in grams , kg , lo etc .
Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it .
A strand of mRNA can be translated several times .
He also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel .
They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader 's attention , 'Grab your telescope !
`` Based on the students data , plastic type B stretched the most .
You ca n't do an experiment if you do n't know what you 're testing on .
They are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything .
He finds out Mr.Leonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm .
The four different samples , mass of them , and where they were put is stated .
That would keep the doghouse warm .
I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant .
a ) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most .
In the end they both bettered the other and a way .
Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible .
I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common .
Pandas and koalas are both similar because they are specialists or only eat a very limited variety in foods .
Further on , the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be .
I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment .
The author starts with an attention getter .
the person lets you know what the sections are about .
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows , mRNA enters a ribosome .
The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used .
Mr. Leonard does n't know how to read and is helping Paul with hurdles .
^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
Next , tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein .
She knows that she has a role in her family .
''Anna , ' Rose said .
The author organized the article in a unique way .
Anna says , ' I 'm so lonesome for Papa .
Koalas & pandas differ from pythons because a python is a generalist & pandas and koalas are specialists .
The panda and koalas eat resources people need .
First the author catches your attention and states the problem .
You feel okay ? '
This makes it hard for the m to survive anywhere else .
Then he uses the heading Crash Course to talk about the different crashes between free-orbting satelites in the past .
Lastly , i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team .
According to the student 's results , type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable .
They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment .
^p 2 ) Compare their results with another group .
When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him .
It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles .
That 's why people consider it a invasive animal because it changes the environment .
The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be .
Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically .
Rose is compassionate .
In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space .
So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school .
Once again in others words Paul was about to get Mr. Leonard some help with his reading problem .
Also , this procedure needs to include weigh the samples .
Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel .
He organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' means intruding .
How much vinegar to pour into the samples ? .
The author starts the article with an attention getter .
They both have big population in their countries and they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus leaves .
The author then goes on and explains what space junk is then how it is dangerous .
In order to replicate this experiment , i would needed to know the different types of samores .
Paul 's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard 's background evokes this generosity .
^p 2 .
The auther organized the thoughts with ledgible Headings such as 'What is space junk . '
^p B ) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic .
A .
^p b ) 1 ) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape .
^p b .
In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna 's hopes up .
To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers .
^p B ) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are .
^p b . )
I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be .
I believe that the author did a good job of organizing this article .
Without this section , one may be confused as to what the author is talking about .
Robray MacInnes distinguishes between the the two by saying that generalists favor change and specialists favor stability .
She believes that when you help someone , they will help you in return .
I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading .
The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention .
Plastic type A is stronger than the rest .
The author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space .
Osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane .
They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were .
After school she goes to work , then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner .
Paul is confused and somewhat angry .
What he learns about Mr. Leonard gives him hope and makes him want to work hard for Mr. Leonard .
Shes wishes for alone time and free time , but knows she has the duty of helping her family .
Towards the end of the story it makes them closer .
Paul was amazed that Mr. Leonard 's background information was that he broke college records his freshman year .
It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least .
She realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed .
They both ca n't , or have trouble , reading .
It helps him to better understand Mr. Leonard .
Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information .
Her aunt then begins to question her about if she feels weighted down .
It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner .
Passive transport requires no energy .
The author begins the article with a common phrase 'It 's a bird !
They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity .
The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
Also they could have used a control for comparison . ''
Pandas & Koalas are similar because they are both specialist species .
and Crash Course
Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain .
( A ) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched .
Change as goes on now , favors the generalist . ''
In the paragraph 'What Is Space Junk ' the author defines what is causing the problem in space .
( 1 ) .
This process is repeated until a stop code is reached .
This adittional data will make the results clearer .
the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
'What Is Space Junk ?
Since he was going through the same .
The author organizes the article with specific titles for each section .
white : : A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside .
This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell .
First , we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment .
To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure .
We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment .
The students need to include what the samples were .
Then in the next section , the author gives the reader background information on space junk .
`` `` Pandas and koalas have a limited area they can live .
Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances .
They both could n't read well .
Paul is amazed that the hall monitor at his school used to be a track star .
Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic .
They could have also added more trials to get a better result .
In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included .
a ) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two .
ONE TRAIT TO DESCRIBE ROSE IS CARING .
Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into .
Paul seemed shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner .
He knows he 's not the only person that ca n't read .
I need to know what the four different samples are .
a .
Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest .
They are able to survive in different climates to adapt to places in different regions .
Paul has a difficult time reading and was never involved with sports .
This could help make sure there was no faulty data , such as an outlier .
Lastly it is important to know how much of each substance to use .
B .
It 's a comet !
Rose is a very helpful person and does stuff that will help other people .
He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles .
'Rose kept nodding .
black : : the color black heats the doghouse the most .
Arguably this animal can live anywhere and can eat a variety of things .
Koala bears and pandas are very much alike .
Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples .
The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results .
He knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud .
It caused some effect on Paul once he knew .
The material also that not include in control groups .
Should I
3 .
Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read .
a .
To replicate this experiment , I would need to know more information .
The second section explains what space junk is , and how it got there .
The cell can use diffusion , or osmosis if the cell is moving water .
Based on the results founded , it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest .
Look up in the sky !
Endocytosis .
The first topic he talks about is what is space junk .
He said 'It 's time to start your training . '
Suddently I realized what I could do for him . '
Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It 's time to start your training . ' .
^p B ) 1 .
The auther breaks up the article into subtopics.such as 'What is space junk ? '
They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists , which means they can live many places .
This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family .
Furthermore , I need to know the amount of each sample needed .
Rose never loses hope .
She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college .
He says that he knew Mr. Leonard 's feelings well because he had often felt them .
The author organized this article by making every section have a diferent topic .
The thrid one is all about satellites colliding together and creating space junk .
a ) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest .
The author organizes this article in a very comprehensive way .
Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm , the least out of all .
Crash Course , follows , talking about how even minor 'space junk ' can be a huge threat .
There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment .
Many fragments float around that can not be detected .
They both have trouble reading .
You can tell from the story that Rose is a considerate person .
a .
Example : 'What is space junk ?
The starting codon is always Met .
However , their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true .
Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency .
She does so many things to be accomplished that she does n't care how stressed out she is .
Mr. Leonard trained Paul , so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read .
One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety .
The background information about Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize how fortunate he was and that he was n't alone .
This forms an amino acid .
`` To replicate the group 's experiment , more information is neccesary .
Then , the author begins telling about space junk and how the government have great concern about space junk .
The author organizes the article by putting it into specific sections .
Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic .
They also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections .
Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him .
a .
The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B .
One example of the would be 'what is space junk ' .
Paul even states'The emotion in Mr.Leonard 's words were all to familiar to me . '
Therefore , a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse .
I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph .
This show Paul 's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things .
`` Koalas and pandas are similar because they are both harmless .
So to me I think black would be the best color .
He then goes into why the problem is dangerous to astronauts and space shuttles .
Then the article has seperate subtopics which state important details relating to the subtopic .
'Its only been four months . '
As she attempts to get out , water fills her mouth and she sinks further down .
But , they are different because of the pythons spread across the remain in their country .
He is surprised by the janitor 's previous experiences .
Also changing the environment could improve the experiment .
This is shown in her conversation with both her sister Anna and Aunt Kolab .
2 .
Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse .
You know by looking in the data table , when they do n't list items in the procedure .
So he asked him about it .
1 .
Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul .
Rose also understands that she needs to keep her job .
One example is the pythons decreasing the wood rat population in the US .
The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison .
He sees that even though Mr. Leonard ca n't read he still had a great accomplishement .
Space junk is pieces of debris from various space crafts and such .
How much should you have in each container ?
The number of pythons are quickly and began to overtake the Everglades .
Look up in the sky !
I think that he was determined to do better .
Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps .
In the investi gation , the air temperature of black was at 53 ( DEG ) .
`` The word invasive , in this sense , means invading the homeland of another and taking over .
The author organizes this article by giving us some information about space junk .
They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container .
^p b .
`` Panda from China are similar to Koalas from Australia because they are both example of specialist species .
People do not realize what harm it could have .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by how they really just eat one type of food .
Then tells a little about the background information .
One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers .
Plastic type A stretched the least .
^p b ) First , the student should have used the same length of each plastic .
He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer .
Paul is concerned that Mr. Leonard did n't tell Paul about his track career before .
The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2 .
He finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact .
Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment .
Active transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using the cell 's energy .
Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk ' are found in space from these previous space missions .
The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black .
He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing .
Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample .
Overall , the author organizes the article in an easy to comprehend , bit-sized manner .
She tries to get her sister to think positive about the situations in their family .
Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard failed out of college because he could not read .
Say what sample to use in the experiment too .
Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab .
They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in ) .
They would also need to include the four samples names , marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
They are native species unlike the generalist python which is considered to be an invasive species by many .
The author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous .
Pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A .
One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container .
When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL , and Paul looks him up , he realizes something important .
They eat things that take them linger to swallow and break it down than koala & panda bears .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a trackstar in college .
Rose has respect for her aunt and her family .
He uses these subtitles to orginize his article .
Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read .
The amino acids bond .
They are different form pythons because pythons are generalist .
Line 1 : 'Grab you telescope !
Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane .
Then comes the Conclusion that gives the author 's opinion on the topic of the 'space junk ' crisis .
Since both of them could n't read in school and wre both great runners .
white : : Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42 ( DEG ) C
Although Mr. Leonard was amazing at track and field , his grades declined and he flunked out of highschool .
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded .
During the story , Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past as a college hurdler .
This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on .
Afterwards , Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate .
The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48 ( DEG ) .
We do n't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used .
The plastics should be a set length .
First , he explained what space junk was , in the section 'What IS Space Junk ? ' .
The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class .
Also a python is carnivorous and it 's died ranges .
Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go .
One might also want to know what type of container , how to write down the findings .
consists of two paragraphs .
Rose is considerate of other people 's feelings .
Paul knows that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too .
The author organizes the article by catching the reader 's attention then informing them what space junk is .
Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid .
By helping him train again .
Lastly , he tells us that little bits of space junk can have a big impact on spacecraft .
This experiment will need more trials to see if the results are convincing .
On average about 6.6 ( DEG ) C cooler , compared with the averages for the other lids .
The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him .
In order to replicate this experiment , you would need corr
She is hardworking .
I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists .
In Summer , you would n't wan t the dog house to be over-heated .
The way that pandas are similar to koalas is that they both only rely on one food source .
Paul was given informattion about Mr. Leonard from when he was younger .
Section one is the explaination of the story .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here , ' ( para .
Also , the students should have specified the weight being used .
The students need to say what the samples are .
^p B ) These students should have conducted a third trial .
She puts her family first in everything she does .
white : : White would be the smarter choice , because it reflects heat verses absorbing it .
Rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education .
The experiment can also describe the materials since the word `` '' materials '' '' can mean almost anything .
After realizing Mr. Leonard 's story , Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him .
You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples .
The author beings the article with an attention graber to introduce what the rest of the article will include .
Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him .
We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2 .
This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help .
Type one is passive transport .
The students could have conducted more trials ( which could have improved the experimental design and validity ) .
Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level .
This means that they are spreading through the wildlife while simultaneously becoming a threat to biodiversity .
Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most .
The author organizes the article in different titled sections .
Rose is hopeful .
It also suprised him that Mr. Leonard had never told him about his records .
One trait that we can see in Rose is that she does n't like to hurt people .
Rose is a responsible person .
And , like how Mr. Leonard had helped him , Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard .
He actually begins to feel adequate .
The author organizes this article into diffrent categories .
One prcess is the use of the semi-permeable membrane which regulates what goes in and out of the cell .
This is similiar to Paul 's situation .
However , you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed .
Therefore , states that Panda 's and Koalas are different .
Both species are specialists- they have adapted to certain conditions & havea hard time with change .
This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results .
Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane .
they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar .
`` `` This shows that both animals are specialists and they eat food that come from plants .
The author organizes the article by having an introduction that grabs the readers attention .
You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be .
Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane .
If they wa nted the temperature to be warm , they would paint the doghouse black .
It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early .
Both these animals are different from pythons .
Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement .
Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport .
And also have started out with the same length for every plastic .
A ) In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes .
They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample .
The second section , 'What Is Space Junk ?
First he talks and informs us about the general idea of Space Junk .
Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received .
Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample .
Energy Required.2 .
The author starts off with getting your attention .
The author has separated these things into three sections .
Also list the type of meteral they roused .
For example , pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Rose is a very optimistic person .
First , the mRNA goes to a ribosome .
At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'It 's time to start your training .
a .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
Other pairs of the word were they used to leaves live .
The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm , that is more than any other bag in the two trials .
Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp .
Since he flunked out of college nobody wanted a runner that could n't read .
She keeps working towards a better future for her family and herself .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past he is surprised .
Under 'Crash Course ' , he talks about satellites and their possibilities of crashing or becoming a free-orbiting satellite .
Litlle Bits , But Big Deal talks about how it does cause a problem for the arstronauts and spacecraft .
They do n't state what the samples have to be .
Each titled section gives a small idea of what information is described in the next couple of paragraphs .
No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read .
He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally .
I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42 ( DEG ) c .
The author organizes this article under different headings .
Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup .
In the data , plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1 , and 23mm in T2 .
^P B .
^P 2 ) They could 've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes .
I do n't know if they need to stay at room temp , cold or not .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four .
Pythons are generalists , they can move anywhere and adapt to their surroundings to survive .
The author then gives background information of how the space junk got into orbit .
As we see when he says 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
a .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus , it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome .
By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place .
In the introduction , the author opens with a surprising statement of a toolbag in space .
Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles .
3 .
A .
The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing .
a ) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample .
However , we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing , and can not overheat .
It would n't be to hot or to cold for the dog .
Though space junk is increasing , the author is hopeful for a solution .
Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading .
Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial .
They be at a loss of food and climate change .
^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples .
Al so , white looks much better on houses than black , dark grey , or light gre y .
Rose is a very posistive individual .
the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary .
The python , on the other hand , is a generalist carnivor that will eat any meat .
Rose said , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
Before defining space junk , a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced .
Also what size container should be used .
She is hoping and trusting that Paul will do well in college .
One kind act to another is exactly what has happened .
black : : We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat .
Well a python is a generalist and eats any thing that is isining and small enough .
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results .
That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person .
The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials .
None of the other plastic types stretched as much , Plastic D one the closest at 20mm .
The author uses an 'attention-getter ' at the beggining of the article to draw readers in .
When Paul does find out his story he asked about it .
The articles names are ' What is Space Junk ? '
The first section defines 'space junk ' for the reader .
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used .
She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her .
The results werent valid .
You would also have to know where you 're leaving these containers .
white : : the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature .
Lastly , the article explains what is being done about this problem .
Firstly the author grabs the readers attention .
Pandas `` '' eats almost nothing but bamboo '' '' ( Achenbach ) .
Cells can use Active Transports , which is where there is energy used .
Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics .
If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy .
Also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over . ''
To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers .
They should of had a control grap .
^p b . )
Diffusion is another way of transporting substances .
Endocytosis : In this process , a cell brings in molecules or substances , which requres energy .
Rose is caring and does n't like to upset others .
The student should have done another trial and have a control group .
This in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother .
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist .
the black colored lid is 9 ( DEG ) warmer than the white col ored lid .
Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can live many places .
Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also could n't read .
Rose is an optimistic person .
`` Many species go on the verge of being extinct due to predators becoming more abundant to an area .
Also , from the student 's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are .
The author then describes in great detail what exactly space junk is and what is made up of .
I believe that Rose is careing .
The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples .
So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out .
In order to replicate this experiment , the group would need some additional information in their procedure .
The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure .
Plastic Type B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least .
He then explores the topic in more detail , using three different sections .
'Soon I realized what I could do for him . ' C'mon , Mr .
One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability .
Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area .
This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab .
According to the results from the experiment , the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53 .
They could of repeated the procedure one more time .
Simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient .
Paul is encouraged .
The author organizes the article into three specific sections , 'What is space junk ?
Those who support this statement would consider the python invasive . ''
Paul 's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting Mr. Leonard about the startling information he discovered online .
Mr. Leonard then tells him , ' I was a good athlete ... but not a good student .
Rose is hard working .
Mr. Leonard gave paul some confidence .
The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops .
1 .
One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk ' the author answers just that question .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonard 's words were all too familiar .
`` There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment .
Next , there are 2 paragraphs about crash courses with the title of 'Crash Course ' .
The the author broke the article down into sections .
Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm .
Once grabbing the readers attention , he breaks the article into several segments labeled , 'What Is Space Junk ?
Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard , he is encouraged , almost dumbfounded .
In order to increase the validity of the experiment .
Paul had no idea that his new coach was even a runner .
This person also starts out by asking a question and then going into what is Space junk .
Paul learns that Mr.Leonard was very good at track in college .
and all samples must be put in the same areas .
The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain .
The next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships .
This is where Rose shows her maturity .
They are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals and can be dangerous .
He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self .
Both the panda and koala are specialists .
The author organizes this article so that it is easy for the reader to understand .
white : : The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest .
' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , it 's time to start your training . '
Next , they talk about the damage space junk can do .
What temperature would the samples be in , would it be the same or would it be different ?
Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23 .
One thing the student could 've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size .
Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels .
Rose is kind at heart .
In order to replicate ta experiment , a person would need to know a few more things .
In the introduction it catctes the readers atention by using shocking statements .
Type D made no change , it streched the same amount for both trials .
I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones .
The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time .
The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked .
I can not draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table .
An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance .
For and pandas and koalas mostly eat leaves and stuff like that .
They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them .
Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference .
'Crash Course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves .
He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place .
Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic .
a .
Anna said , 'Money is n't everything . '
Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read .
I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant .
At first Paul just sees Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor in his school .
Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip .
) .
For instance , one of the titles is called , 'Crash Course . '
In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm .
He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked .
One of the subheadings is : What Is Space Junk ? .
Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand .
This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person .
This would ensure which plastic is the strongest .
By explaining what is space junk and describing how it got out in space and is still out there .
I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container .
white : : White .
The author also labeled the paragraphs with specific titles that forshadowed what you was going to be reading next .
The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar was increased or decreased .
The author organizes the article by having an interesting introduction that catches the reader 's attention .
Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation .
Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples .
You 'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs .
You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors .
One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable .
In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are .
This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment .
In paragraph 45 , Paul relates to Mr. Leonard 's life .
When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard 's struggle to learn , Paul feels a connection with him .
The author organizes this article because each section provides different details to different aspects of spance junk .
She is also protrayed as very realistic .
For this to be a valid experiment , we would need to use the same amount of vinegar .
In the story Rose asks Anna , 'You feel okay ? '
When he found out about this information , he was very empethetic .
white : : the dog house will not be to hot .
I should have the exact type of material .
This debris is very troublesome because spacecrafts get damaged by this debris and it becomes very dangerous .
It gave Paul the bright idea to help Mr. Leonard read .
Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar .
He then changes his tone to that of a more formal one .
Then after he gains our attention he explains what space junk is .
Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard .
First , he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
One trait that decribes Rose would be caring .
Secondly , it tells you the risk and chances of satellites colliding with each other .
The Chinese panda and Australian koalas are similar species .
( 4 ) The protein is then added to a chain which codes for specific genes .
First , they need to specity what the
Pandas and Koala 's eats depend on one food source Panda 's depends on bamboo .
The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration .
^p b . )
Also , they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used .
black : : This color ( black ) will help the dog house stay/become warmer .
They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data .
What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope .
That means that it is able to adapt to changes .
And while helping him , it would also improve Paul 's reading skills .
When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard , he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard .
The author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction .
So he began teaching Mr. Leonard how to read .
The background information helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard .
1 .
He realized why Mr. Leonard was so interested in helping him better himself .
Type A stretched the lease , in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm .
But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20 , still being close to B .
It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister , Anna Whats wrong .
Another plant , but grown from trees .
The information Paul learns inspires him .
Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane .
The by giving the article different sections with different names graps more attention .
Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial .
^p b ) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use .
Paul suddenly realizes why this janitor was helping him out so much .
One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container .
I would have to know whatknd of samples to use .
Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide .
How big the containers are ^p 5 .
He learned that he had to be determined no matter how discouraging the lack of reading skills truly is .
And this reminded Paul of himself and pushed him to work harder for him .
Both the panda and koalas differ from pythons because pythons are `` generalists '' , not `` specialist '' .
One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials .
Also , to improve validity , the student should have had the same starting length of plastics .
But when talking to her Aunt , she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go .
white : : It Was The Coolest With the Temp .
The author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere .
Rose is a caring person .
These things are all very important information that was n't included .
The word invasive when the tain approving bear in the article . ''
You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample .
Such as why , out of all people he choose Paul to work with .
She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab .
He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk ' with his primary thesis .
At the end of the story Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him read .
They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar .
They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours .
In the What Is Space Junk ?
b .
Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B , stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2 .
' I ca n't read . '
The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes .
Both are mammals unlike the python which how many different food/prey and is a reptile .
a ) My hypothesis , that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct .
Each section gives information about what happens .
Rose talks to her until she exits to bed .
Since white had less heat , they would w ant to paint the dog house white .
white : : White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors .
The author purpose to raise awareness over our space travels and its consequences .
It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied .
she is hard working all the time .
The article is organized with a title and sub-headings that emphasize the main points .
Panda 's eat almost nothing but bamboo , while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively .
They explained what Space Junk was and how it was harmful .
They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about , space junk .
Cells also use osmosis , which is diffusion but with water .
Type A stretched the most .
And what kind of container casinial use .
You feel okay ? '
What are the samples ?
a ) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most .
Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it does n't state .
In the story states that Paul took his free time to print out a paper about Mr. Leonard .
My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others .
The following section explains collisions involving space debris .
Lastly , the author summarizes the article and giving the reader the main idea of the article .
This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more .
Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was ; Paul could n't read .
- he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4 .
The section labeled 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections .
The next day after finding the information about Mr. Leonard .
And probably her aunt would tell her mom ' this describes her puting her familly before herself .
Paul gets some interesting background information on Mr. Leonard .
The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by : 1 .
Plastic type B stretched 22mm , then 23mm the second time .
Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do .
When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked .
In the story , Rose is a hard worker , and respects other 's feelings .
With sections having titles , What is sapce junk , and then having information under the section titles .
^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers .
Like in the second sentance of paragraph 23 she said 'maybe her life would get easier ' .
Supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article .
I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get .
You might also need to know to know the constants .
As the article said , snakes are endangering five species in Florida keys .
Finally , the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table .
One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers .
3 .
Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' helps to create a debate in the article .
The author organizes the article by using interesting facts to grab the reader 's attention .
Problems like 'disastrous holes ' .
The mRNA is being transcribed .
Third , you need to state the size of the containers .
The name of the title gives the reader an idea of what the passages will be about .
It needs to be explained what the samples are of .
It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in .
Based on the student 's data , it 's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest .
Dark gray has trials that are 48 ( DEG ) C which is hot .
Since they are natural predators , they are invading and eliminating the lives of other animals .
In the procedure , it does not tell you what the samples are , if you need to use
Paul asks why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him when he was coaching Paul .
However pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates .
Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42 .
Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results .
white : : The lighter the color , the cooler the dog wil l be .
Uncomparable .
Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is .
The next section is 'What is Space Junk ? ' .
The similarities between pandas and koalas is they do n't eat meat .
An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis .
The student also could have been more specific in their procedure .
The author organizes the article in four sections .
The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial , and if needed , a fourth .
Also , he feels that he can compensate for Mr. Leonard 's training by teaching him to read .
Just like the pandas koalas eat almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
The author starts off by telling us what space junk is .
Rosa was kind to Aunt Kolab when she did n't answer the question .
For example in paragraph nineteen it say 's Rose did n't answer .
He almost draws closer to Mr. Leonard because he realizes they both have something in common .
We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment .
Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it .
The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm .
The need to have all the materials and put it in order .
to explain the main detail that the artical is about .
Surprisingly , Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized .
The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics .
First , I would need to know what type of material is being used .
One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment .
Rose is a very understanding person .
Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm .
They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control .
It 's a comet !
Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial .
Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer .
Their are three things wrong with this procedure .
A .
When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard 's background it was all to familiar to Paul .
white : : The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way .
Osmosis : Diffusion involving water .
The west flexible type of plastic was type B .
A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest .
A .
Bad reading skills , trained to get good at track , etc .
He did not want Paul to go through what he did .
Then , the second section is titled 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Next , the author really explains to the reader what space junk is .
Another improvement could 've been to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment .
You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system .
We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup .
In paragraph 43 , paul mentions that Mr. Leonard went to colleage .
Under the section titled 'What is Space Junk ?
responding : air temp .
so not too much thermal energy , but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best .
Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given .
dark gray : : The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray .
Also what siz container .
The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is .
Through learning this , Paul is able to empathize .
Then telling you wat makes the space junk .
He begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader .
It shows Paul that school is important .
Paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either .
'What is Space Junk ' is where he basically tells us just a general idea about it .
The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results .
They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers , which could also impact result .
It allows water in and out without trouble .
Next he describes how these space projects have caused problems and what they are sugesting to do .
He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles .
It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
2 .
This also encourages him to push himself to be able to read better .
Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ?
You also need to know what the conditions are made out of .
They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount .
What type of container , how much vinager .
When Rose is talking to Anna , she shows that she is selfless .
I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container .
( ex 5 minutes )
Paul also is a little confused on how Mr. Leonard didnt make it as a runner .
The background information has an effect on Paul because Paul can relate to it .
The author organizes this article by explaining different problems with orbiting space junk in each section .
Paul is shocked by the background information that he receives from Mr. Leonard .
The measures of every plastic should be the same to start .
Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them .
How do you measure the ending mass of each sample ?
Day or night ?
You broke records . '
The author organizes the article with facts of 'space junk ' that are in space due to space exploration .
One process used by cells is endocytosis .
They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample . ''
Based on her converstation with Anna , Rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person .
Paul was surprized by the fact Mr.Leonard cant read , and that he was in college .
Type C streched 14mm in T1 , but in T2 strech only 13mm .
The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains .
The author organizes the article with subtitles .
During the story , the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard .
black : : The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse .
Mr. Leonard 's past also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read .
That Mr. Leonard was good but not school wise .
explains space exploration and how man-made objects are in space orbit .
They think its a major threat to the food chain and to biodiversity .
'What is Space Junk ? '
Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard 's words .
The author wraps up the article by giving future problems that could occur
So he feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and decides to help him .
This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong ' ?
This group left same very important thing out of their procedure .
It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free .
Just like Mr. Leonard did by helping him get on the track team .
How much vinegar and the students pour into each container .
The author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other .
Finally , I would need to know what to label each container .
The first paragraph , the introduction , introduces the topic of the article .
Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane .
Paul understood what Mr. Leonard felt like .
Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful .
Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon , the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond .
so by paint ing the doghouse white , the temperature in the doghouse will stay low .
The additional information needed would be : the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup .
For this experiments duplication , you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup .
By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning , we could see the change that occured .
It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table .
Rose immediately took in her sister 's body language and asked her what was wrong .
Under the subtitle 'Crash Course ' the author tells about a collision that happend .
But yes I am shure that Paul was very suprised once he looked up the website .
So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white .
He sees how even though Mr. Leonard could n't read that he still excelled past people in something else .
`` Panadas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they mainly only eat one type of food .
1.How much vinegar & how big a container ?
No energy is required for this process .
White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot .
I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work .
Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2 .
for black was 53 ( DEG ) , while the average for white was 42 ( DEG ) .
A ) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability .
And then he gose and showes him how to read .
Once its in , the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three .
Mr. Leonard 's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar .
Paul shows this by saying ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard .
How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights .
This is because they are not used to having pythons there .
The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections .
Rose doesnt want to move to Cambodia and her aunt understands that .
It even inspires Paul to start to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples .
'Now , instead of two disabled satellites , there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space . '
The next section provides information on the dangers of space junk and debris in orbit .
Paul is surprised about the background information .
The author starts off trying to lure the reader asking a question .
Where should the samples dry , warm , cold , in the sun ?
There are many things she wants for herself in life .
Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share .
If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties .
' C'mon , Mr. leonard , ' I said walking back toward school .
You would need to know how big the containers were .
Neither of them can read very well .
They could have repeated the experiment more , to validate their results .
The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees .
You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples .
he never knew how to read .
The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows :
.
My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag .
These two species are different from a python because a python is a generalist species .
You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with .
It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers .
Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment .
The panda needs to eat its bamboo and the koala needs to eat its eucalyptus leaves .
Panda 's from China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both harmful .
Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr period , or do you just leave them uncovered ?
The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes .
The line 'It 's a .
After the realization of Mr. Leonard 's past , Paul wanted to help him .
Species that do five things are called invasive . ''
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read .
^p B .
When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be , Paul was filled with unbelief .
Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers .
Then her aunt realized that the family relies heavily on her and tries to make it easier on her .
Rose is a very responsible girl .
^P b .
This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds .
This makes the article much easier to understand
Finally he explaines exactly how it is dangerous and what he can do .
She works way too much to where shes falling asleep doing her work . '
I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself , but of her family .
but he labels 'is ' itallicized because he is trying to make a point .
In the story Rose is a very giving person .
`` Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists .
a . )
The author has organized this article by asking questions or stating a subtitle for the next paragraph to answer .
Also , we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open .
Mr. Leonard 's background information inspires Paul .
For example , the subtopic 'Crash Course ' tells the danger of satellites colliding together .
The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article .
It stretched 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one .
Transcription occurs here .
How long do you rinse the samples ?
Rose didnt want to hurt Aunt Kolab , or make her feel bad .
black : : Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter .
A control ( one with just pure water ) is needed to increase validity .
This person organizes it by having head lines in bold letters .
I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials .
This has an overwhelming difference of 11 ( DEG ) C after JUST 10 minutes
Also , they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate .
A ) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable .
The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes .
He is helping Paul become the athlete that Mr. Leonard used to be .
Panda 's and koalas are both specialists .
They also do n't say how much vinegar should be used .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman .
They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples .
He met a school coach , began hurdling on Mr. Leonard 's track .
The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp .
From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest .
This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems .
Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
He had lost his scholarship though , because he could n't read .
The author organizes the article by topic .
Mr. Leonard did n't have help with his grades .
Chinese pandas can eat only bamboo while Australian koalas eat only eucalyptus too .
This made Paul respectful and obedient to him .
this is how he does it .
a ) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm .
The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard .
It gave Paul hope that some day he would be able to read .
^p 2 .
The next is Crash Course an so on .
I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container .
To replicate this , I need to know what samples I 'm working with .
The `` '' aliens '' '' will then disrupt the biodiversity if it is not held under control .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes .
This causes the reader to wonder if satellites really crash in space .
And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control .
Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it did n't work it was still to hard for him .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star , and that he could not read .
Also , they should 've used a control plastic to compare their results to .
Paul said , 'Learning center . '
They are different from pythons because neither of them eat meat and also pythons are generalist species .
The article starts out with definition 'What Is Space Junk ?
Pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they are less picky in their food choices .
A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment .
Then , at the end he returns him a favor by helping Mr. Leonard become a better reader .
`` Some additional information that would be needed are specific things .
They then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is .
They eat only one thing ; pandas eat bamboo , and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid .
He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does .
Cells use osmosis to either gain or get rid of water by passing it across the cell membrane .
Paul wanted to help out Mr.Leonard , just like Mr.Leonard help him out .
a .
Well as we see on
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
You need a set amount .
The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied .
State how long you are rising the materials in water .
The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer .
Amino acids link together and form a protein
They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article .
They start out my just explaining what they are going to talk about .
The students could have improved the experimental design !
Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container .
When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles he was surprised .
Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate .
Rose is very mature for her age .
This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter .
They do n't state how they find the mass of each sample .
How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic .
You feel okay ? ''
To emphasize the seriousness of space junk , he relates facts about real crashes that have occured .
And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused .
Then the author gives some information about how dangerous space junk can be .
If this happens , the competition may leave the native species endangered or even intimet .
I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container .
Paul knows how if feels to not be able to read .
The word `` invasive '' in the article is reffering to certain species that are disrupting the ecosystem .
However , he was a good runner .
Also I would need to know where I should place a sample .
He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades .
`` Panda 's and koala 's have similar ways to animals life .
Plastic type A was the least stretchable .
Also , Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away .
One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion .
The writer splits the most important facts into seperate paragraphs .
The author starts out by telling the reader that a tool bag is floating in space .
The weight was and how many clamps to use .
You would also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in .
Fir example , the Burmese python is threatening fire endangered species in the filmla keys .
The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration .
'He had to go .
Australia 's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
They both rely on eating just one thing , bamboo or eucalyptus leaves exclusively .
in darkness outside ?
They are both covered in for & can live in cooler climates .
Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome .
This needs to be included in the procedure .
Her not telling the truth to her Aunt , shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings .
The ending creates a good give-take relationship .
He was grateful for everything , so he decided to return the favor .
Type A only stretched 12 mm .
You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use .
^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic .
If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected .
Next , the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1 .
The reason she cares about her is that Anna is Rose 's sister
The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one .
The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water .
To begin , the author grabs the reader 's attention with an interesting introduction .
He wants to try to do something for himself because of the affect Mr. Leonard had an on him .
This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm .
If one plastic has more weights than the another , it will make this experiment not valid .
A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not there is a control in the experiment .
My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy .
Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard .
Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags .
Rose said ' What 's wrong ?
All they tell us is vinegar .
'Anna , ' Rose said .
So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track .
Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials .
That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white .
Chinas panda and Australias koala bear are both specialist species .
They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners .
After Paul learns of Mr. Leonard 's past , he is curious and surprised .
The first paragraph is a very good attention getter it makes it clear to grab your attention .
Also , to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four .
Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon , the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein .
Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane .
Paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read .
The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein .
The United States followed suit , and thus began the human race 's great space invasion . '
Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch .
Osmosis-water through the cell membrane2 .
The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard changes his views .
He was surprised at at how Mr. Leonard had never shared his elite college hurdling experience .
The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types .
The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles .
The python would try to eat anything that it thinks its able to to eat .
The author uses subtiles to help orginize the information in the article .
Finding one with a tracker in the python 's stomach concludes that this reptile is invasive . ''
So that is how the author organizes this well written article .
The author organizes the aritcle to explain everything in order .
Paul had the same problem , he couldnt read also .
The group also does not tell you how to way each sample 's mass .
Rose does not answer this question , because she does n't want to hurt her aunt 's feelings .
A . )
white : : White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse .
Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles , and had trouble reading .
This will help because during the summer when it is hot , it will keep the doghouse cooler .
He had finally found someone who in all reality , was just like him .
I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him .
These 2 animals differ from pythons because they are considered specialists as pythons are generalists .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm .
Rose is compassionate .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
`` Koalas & Pandas are both animals that are becoming extinct .
molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts .
Pythons however do n't need special things to live .
The author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used .
They are not carnivors like pythons .
They display some of the same traits .
I think that invasive is a passing judgment . '' ''
They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were .
^P 1 .
The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results .
My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct .
They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic .
They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve .
He feels like he knew exactly where Mr. Leonard was coming from .
Another process if diffusion , which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past , Paul feels like he can relate to this .
Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track .
The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations .
Pandas in China eat basically only bamboo and koalas in Australia basically only eat eucalyptus leaves .
thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot .
It reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading .
One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
What type of vinegar and does temperature matters .
It 's a comet !
The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control .
In the last paragraph , paul wants Mr. Leonard to start training .
'What is Space Junk ' , is the title for the first couple of paragraphs .
^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers .
She does not like hurting other people .
plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm , the furthest .
Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm , which was the largest length after five minutes .
The two ways students can improvr the experimenta ; design , is to always give it a 3rd try .
^p 3 ) How much vinegar to put the samples in .
Rose did n't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings .
Facilitated Diffusion , energy and protein is moved from low to high concentration .
The first tRNA floats away , leaving the amino acid behind .
The risks and dangers are further explained in , 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal . '
Lastly , the author explains how scientists are trying to fix the space junk problem .
Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in .
As he goes on he talks about what happens with a collision .
The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container .
Then when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard cant read either he has remorse for him .
He realizes that he is just like Mr. Leonard because they both can not read .
Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard 's experience .
She did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt .
Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp .
Then , Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college .
THe three types are diffusion , facilitated diffusion , and active transport .
but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read .
It should say how much vinegar to use .
A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm .
Cells can also use diffusion .
First , you would need to know what materials to use as samples .
She assured her that her father was doing the right thing by working in Los Angeles .
Of course they do , so that 's one .
In exocytosis , vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell .
Finally , they end with saying that NASA is trying to fix this problem .
This is what we must know to replicate this experiment .
this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house .
Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read .
Paul was surprised at the information he obtained regarding Mr. Leonard 's past .
How much of each sample is being poured into the container ?
After reading the group 's procedure , I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment .
The author organizes the article by different topics .
^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more . ''
Without a control , we do n't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason .
Panda 's in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because Panda 's eats almost nothing but bamboo .
In this section , the author gives background information about where space junk comes from .
Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships , and how ships can not avoid it easily .
It 's the stretchiest .
and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
One trait of Rose is that she is caring .
Also , pandas and koalas are warm blooded and sakes are cold blooded .
Rose is a hardworking girl .
So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse .
One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport .
The python can live almost anywhere and eat a variety of things .
Based on the data , plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable .
An example of this trait can be seen when she asks Anna if she is alright .
Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration .
In able to have the experiment preesse .
^p 4 .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia in the fact that they are both specialists .
There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment .
^P b ) -1 ) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were .
Very hopeful for good to come to her life .
The group needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials .
Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read .
You would also have to know how big in size each container was .
First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab .
What is your control .
and so on and so fourth .
Mr. Leonard was a star in college and wanted Paul to suceed .
As the author continues through the essay , he/she adds factual information on the hazards of space debris .
Then they start to bring out facts and statistics .
A ) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable .
Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student .
Pythons are generalists , pandas and koalas eat only one thing .
The one trait I depicted from this passage was that Rose is grown up .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both herbavors .
Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell .
Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading .
Rose does not want to hurt her family , therefore she is caring .
The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to .
Paul asked 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
Cells use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane .
By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone .
This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse .
and specify the size and type of the containers used ( beakers )
Active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat .
The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine .
So , i n conclusion , I 've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice .
You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L .
mainly scotching hot .
Therefore , Paul understood why Mr. Leonard tried so hard to help him excel at something .
College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades did n't matter and that they would have tutors for him .
The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers .
It helps Paul know that he is n't the only one with this problem .
The author put titles about pargraphs that descibe something about space junk .
I t hought it might be too hot for the dog .
Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm .
The author organizes the article in sub-headdings .
The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis .
He/she does this by using exclamation and question marks .
Finally he explains what organizations like NASA and ESA are doing to solve the problem .
The author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections .
This keeps the reader interested and wanted to read more without getting too bored with all the information .
This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments .
You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material , for example plastic could
Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister .
They are both different from a python because a python is a generalist while pandas and koalas are specialists .
If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers , where do they go for 24 hours ?
I would also need to know the problem to this experiment .
light gray : : The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey .
`` The group of students did n't specify what `` '' samples '' '' they were referring to .
The author organizes the article into three different sections .
For example , add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes .
Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material ; in sunlight ?
Then , he provides the audience with information about what space junk is .
Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials .
Each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last .
They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic . ''
I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container .
The final section talks about the power of space junk falling from the atmosphere .
Rose , while feeling overwhelmed , tried to be optimistic in most situations .
Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot .
The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two .
It also gives light to possible solutions .
'Anna , what 's wrong ?
^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it .
Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis , diffusion , and active transport .
Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top .
This allows the reader to take in as mcuh information as possible .
Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals . ''
She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab .
I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings .
Mr. Leonard stays after school even longer to help Paul .
Then it needs to state how much of each `` '' sample '' '' .
This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems .
Koalas and pandas are both specialist animals that only eat a cenant type of plant .
However , Aunt Kolab is very understanding and talks through the situation with her niece .
They both have only eats one type of food .
Overall plastic A is the most durable .
In the story , Mr. Leonard helps Paul become a good athlete after learning that he ca n't read .
Specialist can only live one areas nway in contrast to generalist who can adapt and live almost anywhere .
Three , what you are measuring the weight in .
^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with .
b ) The student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial .
Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great track runner in college .
Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop .
Then , I would need to know what the three samples are .
With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold .
The author also states that if space agencies help then maybe space pollution will decrease .
And finally , they end the article with the 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' section .
When Anna brings up their missed father , she blames him for leaving the family .
Rose is very hard working and caring .
Rose is hopeful in the story she realizes maybe her life would get easier .
Step 6 , but they don ; t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf .
In closing , the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem .
Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna .
While she works she still keeps up on school work and helps her aunt cook for the family .
^p 1 .
Also , how big would the cups have to be ?
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past , he is shocked at first .
'It 's time to start your training . '
^p 2 . )
By contrast , the python is a generalist .
it stretched 12mm without breaking .
That is when Paul realized that he and Mr. Leonard were alike in that way .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
the reader gets background on Mr. Leonard from a track website that the Coach gave him to look up .
Paul sees that he 's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read .
You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need .
1. mRNA travels to the ribosomes2 .
White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible .
No other school wanted a runner who could n't read ' .
When paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard this effects Paul in a good way .
You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment .
^p B ) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs .
The effect on the backround information on Paul seemed like they made them very similair in a way .
Exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cell.Ion channels .
Therefore , they can live in many areas and are called generalists .
It 's time to begin your training .
This made Paul feel better about himself , because he is n't the only on with the problem .
He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well .
They should have specified the mass of the weights used .
b ) ( 1 ) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement .
Pandas & koalas both have specialized diets .
Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment .
Pythons and other animals were imported into the states and have been kept as pets .
White would absorb less solar and thermal energy , therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse .
Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples .
They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two .
Also , the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers .
Paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort Mr. Leonard has given to help him .
Paul also figured out that Mr. Leonard could n't read .
In step 5 , it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry .
After hearing this Paul wanted to help train him with his reading .
The student could also say how much weight he was using .
Also , if Paul succeeds , Mr. Leonard does too , since he taught Paul everything .
I prefer this form of organization , as it is easier to read and understand .
Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well .
According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest .
Specify what the samples are in step 1 .
Pythons have already made the change of habitat to everglades in the U.S .
Paul said , 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design .
At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified .
In paragraph 38 , Paul lists his acheivements as a track star .
You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container .
Rose can be described as a hard worker .
In China pandas are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists .
What the four samples are .
An example of this is when she is talking with Anna and says , 'Anna , What 's wrong ?
Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min .
Pythons are capable of eating a bigger diversity and pythons often do best in and around human .
Therefore , Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading .
C stretched the second least ( 14-13mm ) and D closely followed B ( 20mm in stretching ) .
Three trials can help make this definite .
Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment .
Based on the students data you , can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics .
The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock .
white : : I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool .
Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard .
In the article it says pandas and koalas both eat plants .
Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too .
The author organizes the artical by subtitles .
The tRNA then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the tRNA .
Rose ignores the question because she does n't want to hurt her family .
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome .
Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna .
a .
According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials .
They are killing off natural animals such as the key largo wood rat .
Osmosis moves only water across a cell membrane .
the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane .
Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in .
One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in .
In conclusion , plastic type B has the most stretchability .
Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun .
The way the author organizes this article is that he uses a very eye cathing thesis or opening statements .
Paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website .
'Do you feel weighed down by what you 're doing to help this family ? '
They are not limited on food like pandas and koalas are .
In this group 's procedure , they do not state what
white : : White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse .
They were spread then appear similar species .
In trial 1 22mm , and trial 2 23mm .
white : : it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there .
So its fairly compfortable for a dog .
She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future .
And probably her aunt would tell her mother . '
He then explains how satellites crash and how debris is broken off .
Next the author talks about how space junk can be created .
Rose is family oriented , she cares about her family .
The author starts by explaining what the problem is in the section 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
He ended up losing his scholarship , and flunking out of college .
black : : The black paint would absorb heat .
The independent variable is the type of plastic .
However , due to natural disaster , they have managed to escape and moved into the wild .
^p B .
One movement process is called osmosis .
`` `` A specialist is China 's panda , which eats almost nothing but bamboo . '' ''
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm .
White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day .
The student did a good job conducting this experiment .
I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more .
In addition , they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure .
It says `` '' identical '' '' , but does not specify anything else .
Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample .
The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample .
Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read .
black : : Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most .
So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white .
' C'mon , Mr.Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article .
In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things .
The author organizes the article one step at a time .
They also do n't say how much should the samples weigh .
Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat .
This is a positive view that an optomistic person would have .
`` The word invasive sums up the main idea of this article .
Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching .
Ex .
It then begins translation when the anticodons from the tRNA match up with the codons on the mRNA .
You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers .
'What 's wrong ?
After that , in the section titled 'Crash Course ' , the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted .
the author gives a bit of information on what he/she is about to be talking about .
Measure the plastics during the process of stretching .
Passive transport does not use channel proteins , nor does it use energy .
light gray : : The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse .
It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well .
He first talks about Space Junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space .
It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed .
This is because both have stuggled with reading .
The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights .
He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems .
It 's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her .
Then the lab would be performed correctly .
There fore it can survive in a variety of places .
Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a track star , but he flunked out because he made bad grades .
Paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor , Mr. Leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete .
I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most .
Therefore th e dog house should be light grey , it is a happy medium .
And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did .
From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch .
) Why does n't it matter which sample ?
Pandas and the koalas both are herbivores , while the python is a carnivore .
The author then shows an example of two satellites crashing into each other , and an example of microdebris .
Based on the results , plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable .
Cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane .
It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate .
It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he wo n't end up flunking .
Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Paul thought since he got a little help that he could help Mr. Leonard .
Pandas mostly eat just bamboo , and koalas generally only eat eucalyptus leaves .
She cares about her sister Anna .
tRNA creates codons from anticodons3 .
The students should also include the temp .
Which would cause the dog t o overheat .
The temperature the experiment was conducted under .
A .
Most pandas are found in China and most koalas are found in Australia .
Pythons would try to eat other animals , that what makes them different . ''
Neither of these require energy for the cell to use .
'Crash Course ' describes the collisions of satelites in space and also a funny incident including an astronaut .
Which will create a nice segway to talk about 'Little Bits , But a big Deal '
The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences .
In the experiment , lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature .
The author organizes the article by putting it in headings .
Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature .
It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture .
In the text Rose is worried about hurting her mother or her aunt .
Also , what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ?
A python is a generalist , it has a wide habitat range and can eat many different things . ''
Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment .
The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container .
The python however is a generalist it can live anywhere because its able to adapt to its surroundings .
Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights .
`` A ) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least .
In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most .
The author continues with background information .
The reason that the emotions are familiar to Paul is because Paul feels those exact emotions almost every day .
This leads into the subject that many people do , infact , care .
Also , the size of the container would be helpful .
In the he talks about how little pieces of matter are a big deal in the atmosphere .
It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials .
Lastly , you may need to know that the samples are marble , limestone , wood and plastic .
Osmosis is the diffusion of water .
a .
it made him respect Mr.Leonard even more becasue they were alike .
First , the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched .
a .
Pandas and koalas ca n't be adapting like pythons can . ''
The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers .
a ) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment .
All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane .
'Its only been four months , ' Rose said as gently as she could .
then Rose states that she and Anna play a big role in helping Paul finish college .
The author wants the reader to comprehend the amount of space junk in space .
'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me . '
`` Invasive has a negative connotation .
The author then explains why space junk is a problem and specific examples on what could happen .
This differs from a python because they eat meat can possibly hurt someone .
Then it follows into telling the readers a breif history passage about spacecraft .
The jar with the black lid had an average of 53 ( DEG ) C under the lamp .
Like Paul , Mr. Leonard was poor in school .
a ) Based on the students data , I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability .
The background on Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul .
You would also need to know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use .
So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too .
He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete .
It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be .
the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article .
^p b ) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length .
The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control .
Even though it 's a rough situation , she 's looking at what good can come out of it .
Plastic B was the most stretchable .
b ) The student could have had another trial to test validity .
Another improvement wold be more trials .
You feel okay ? '
The author organizes the article into three condenced topics about orbitting junk .
More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons , which produce a growing polypeptide chain .
First the author presents the problem , space junk .
The last little article tells the reader how small but still very dangerous the space junk is .
Pythons are different because there reptiles .
Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2 , 20mm .
The ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem .
Paul finds reading hard ; so does Mr. Leonard .
He then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk .
The author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs .
I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too .
^p b.1 .
What environment is the experiment taking place in ?
T hat is shown by the data , in the 20 ( DEG ) C increase in temp .
There is a disagreement between the pandas and the biologists .
She tries to make sure her sister is okay in paragraph 5 .
He asked questions about it and seemed very interested .
They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container .
a ) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A .
Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading .
Both animals live almost exclusively on a single food source , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively .
They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles .
You would need to know what materials to get .
You could also do the time at different times .
Rose is not living an easy life .
The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete .
This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic .
BobBay MacInnes , a Florida resident and reptile seller , does n't like that pythons are described asInvasive .
Paul feels he can relate to Mr. Leonard .
During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading .
The plasma membrane is semi-permiable .
The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm .
The word `` invasive '' is used to describe the reptiles many times throughout the article .
He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college , that he even broke records .
I think the author did a fine job with organizing this article .
black : : Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm .
Instead it floats around in space .
Facilitated diffusion is diffusion only with large molecules .
Really , though , they are just animals trying to survive .
' , which explains whats happen over the past 52 years .
A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second .
White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color .
' I lost my scholarship and flunked out , ' Mr. Leonard stated .
it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere .
Get it rig ht .
The second section explains how all of this space 'junk ' has gotten there .
I would need the types of sample materials that are being used .
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' is significance to the article because it is the article .
^P b .
Specify how much vinegar in step 2 .
The author organizes the article by giving different sections are the article titles .
Another process is called facilitated diffusion .
The author begins with an eye catching introduction .
The author breaks the article up into smaller sections .
Finally the group did not say the size of the container .
There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it .
Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative 's feelings .
Paul and Mr. Leonard have had very similar childhoods .
Pandas in China & koalas in Australia are similar b/c they both depend on their environment to survive .
He talks about what the big fuss is with the space junk and how it is increasing .
For both trials preformed , type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm .
Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure .
He asked him about it .
Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center .
One trait to describe Rose is loyal .
100 grams ) .
In the story Rose is a very mature girl .
After reading the groups procedure , i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed .
This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis : Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water .
I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment .
Plastic type B stretches the farthest .
Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were .
Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples .
You feel okay ? '
I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen .
Through osmosis , water can freely pass through the membrane .
`` Pandas and koalas are both similar because they can only survive in certain areas .
( a ) Based on the students data , I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least .
Then in each section the author gives details about the topic of the section given away in the titles .
We need those information to know how to do this experiment .
Next , the author describes what space junk is , and how it was created .
2 .
A word that describe her is caring .
Then he explains how it causes satellites to collide into each other .
some of the subtitles they used are What Is Space Junk ?
The first paragraph is to get the readers attention , and make them want to read the story .
Rose seems to be worried about Anna because she comes in the kitchens and immediately asks Anna 'Whats wrong ?
He believes that Paul can do domething great .
The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length .
a .
Should I use a lot of vinegar , or a little ?
The did a really good job organizing the article in subject filed manner .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Other information
'Crash Course ' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause .
a .
No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read .
Since they do n't press danger to people they are similar and also different from pythons .
We need to know how big the sample would have to be .
The author organizes the article by starting off with the question ' 'What Is Space Junk ? '
the doghouse would not likely be made of glass , a nd sealed off from outside air curculation .
It changes the way he looks at Mr. Leonard .
It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles .
B stretched on average 22.5 mm , while the other three ranged from 10-20mm .
Paul does not feel sorry for him just simply wants to help him as his friend had helped Paul .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
The author organizes the article in multiple sections .
He also wants to return the favor by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read .
One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in .
They rely on one exclusive food source .
In the store it states pythons are imperiling live endangered species in the Florida keys .
Both of them are like one another and know how the other feels .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but did n't know how to read .
This allows the reader to always know what 's going on and somewhat outlines the entire article .
a . )
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
The next section explains to readers what space junk is .
When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past .
Thus , creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds .
You feel okay ? '
As the article states in paragraph 11 , the snakes have imperiled 5 endangered species in the Florida keys .
The author organized the article with an inroduction and a body .
In order to replicate this procedures , you would need to know
This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately .
In the story , the trach coach advises Paul to look up background information on Mr. Leonard .
They are much different than python reason being is that pythons will eat anything that is meat .
^p B ) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1 .
When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star , Paul was shocked it seemed .
Plastic type A stretched only 12mm , therefore it stretched the least .
In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done .
Look up at the sky !
The author uses subtitles to organize the article .
They specify to one type of substance that is crucial to their survival that without they could possibility die .
Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added .
Also he should continue with his training so that he can get a schoolarship like Mr. Leonard .
The author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way .
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past , it changes his view of Mr. Leonard .
Also what size .
Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges .
Do the samples stay outside or inside ?
A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins .
Then ends with how the pollution in space is increasing and how it IS a huge problem .
Bamboo and eucalyptus leaves are both plants .
Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity .
of the room .
What kind of `` '' sample of material '' '' are you using .
Even though Paul was good at jumping hurdles , he felt as though he was n't good enough .
Also , Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard .
^p ( B ) One way that the student could 've improved the validity is to add more trials .
The student could have had another trial .
We had no learning centers in our school .
I would say Rose is an understanding person .
How should the samples be removed from the container ?
The amount of vinegar that each container would need .
What type of container should the sample be put into ?
a .
Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt .
Anna could be desribed as understanding .
On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least .
how should i determine the mass of the different samples ?
Therefore , a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray .
Plastic B was the most stretchy .
Mr. Leonard explained to him that he had flunked out .
Paul could n't believe it .
1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2 .
The best plastic type would be A .
Are the different containers made of the same material ?
Step one really should go at the end .
This repeats , with the amino acids joining together , eventually making a protein .
Unlike pythons that eat a variety of animals , rather than a specific plant .
This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color .
b ) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways .
The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic .
Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2 .
Without this information , the results would be inaccurate .
Also , good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials .
The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z .
When he asks Mr. Leonard about it he finds that Mr. Leonard ca n't read either .
The author organizes the article like this to make the reader understand without getting confused .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist .
Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment .
Crash Course explains how an American and Russian satellite crashed , resulting in small pieces of debris .
They both like stability , unlike the python these animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalists .
But she is doing what she can to make the best of it .
^p should they be relatively the same size ?
Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did .
It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk .
Next , you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster .
I would also need to know what type of containers to use .
^p B ) The students could have done more trials .
And how do you determine the mass .
After this the author seperates the rest of the article into three sections , 'What Is Space Junk ? '
Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star .
One process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis .
Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4 .
I would even like
These specialist need their warm climates while generalists can adapt .
Pythons in Asia inhabit climates like that of the u.s says the article . ''
I would need to know the original size of each of the four different samples .
So Paul says ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' I said , walking back toward school .
Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does .
This meaning that they generally only eat one type of food , as described in paragraph 21 .
They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on .
Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way .
The author puts thihs information under a section called Crash Course .
for example , the header stating 'What Is Space Junk ? '
The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard .
The next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk .
The third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space .
Plastic B stretched the most .
In trial one and as well as trial two .
When paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery .
From that point on Paul helps Mr. Leonard with his reading .
One trait of Rose 's is reassurance .
This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable .
I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use , it does n't state it clearly .
You broke records . '
To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant .
This information also makes Paul realize that he also experiences the same feelings while he 's at school .
The need to have his own question .
Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data .
I would also need to know what the four different samples were .
Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard actually have a lot in common .
Pythons are a danger to other species unlike pandas and koala bears who only eat plants .
Paul can sympathsize with Mr. Leonard because they are both not very good at something .
The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial .
When Mr. Leonard was in school , they did n't have learning centers to help people read .
First he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea .
I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size .
when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color .
During protein synethesis , the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription .
After reading this procedure , I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar .
Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics .
They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk ? ' .
The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without .
For example , the headers 'What Is Space Junk ? '
She tell Anna that their brother will get a job after college to pay for their college education .
Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class , but he was extremely embarrassed .
Paul only finds out about him when he talks to the school 's track coach .
A Chinese Panda `` '' eats almost nothing but bamboo . '' ''
Also there should have been more than two trials .
Paul can feel the emotions that Mr. Leonard is feeling .
The last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal .
So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read .
^p B .
They also could of hard more plastics .
First you need to know what type of samples your using .
The author also organizes it by the titles of the paragraphs .
So Paul decided to help him read .
Paul was surprised to fing out that Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
This trait is evident in paragraph 19 ( sentences 1 and 2 ) .
' .
Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently , making the experiment inaccurate .
Active transport requires energy , this may use transport protiens .
the information showed that Mt .
A cell 's membrane is selectively permeable .
Clean-up is possible .
After leaving the Nucleus , the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3 .
Type C is almost the same firmness as A , and D has almost the same stretch as B .
This guy was just like Paul .
Three types of movement that cells use to move substances acrossed the membrane are , one is osomis .
And type C , D were C , 14 T1mm , 13 T2mm , D 20T1mm , 20 T2mm .
But pythons eat other animals .
This process requires no energy.3 .
They when paul figured out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college , paul knew felt his pain .
Without these you can not replicate the experiment .
Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it .
is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage .
Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit .
Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp .
white : : White would be the best color to paint the do g house .
Another tells us about some satellites craching into others and making more space junk .
Paul is affected by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard in many way .
Next , the author begins the section called 'What is Space Junk ? '
Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container .
I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment .
The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self .
Rose is considerate of other peoples feelings .
He felt familiar with the emotions of embarrrassment that Mr. Leonard felt .
He could not read .
You can understand this from her converstation with Anna .
Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me .
Also Paul finding out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star has a big effect .
They organize it by making up sections .
Paul also understood how Mr. Leonard felt ; embarrassment , and the longing to be like other kids .
Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples .
Space junk should not be considered a minor matter .
In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material .
A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength .
The author then gives an explanation for what he or she is writing about .
^p B .
I would need to know what were the four different samples .
When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt , she must then do her homework .
Objects in space are considered orbiting satellites which is dangerous for astronauts .
example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black .
A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment .
Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well .
A ) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid .
These results are valid because of the two trials , so I can confidently conclude this .
This is very significant because this means their numbers can not be kept in check and they might overpopulate .
she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
No college wanted someone who could n't read .
Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read .
In the article it says that the pandas mostly eat bamboo and koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves .
I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at .
She does everything she needs to do to make her family 's plan go smoothly .
In the experiment , black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar ( 53 ( DEG ) C )
Look up in the sky !
The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant .
Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration .
Finally he concludes by saying that the space junk will continue to increase until a solution is found .
What containers should we use ?
Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic .
The first section informs the reader a basic explanation of what space junk is .
After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
In conclusion , plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each .
The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard 's favor of teaching him to run track .
Secondly , they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp .
Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container .
Paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help Mr. Leonard .
A ) In conclusion , my hypothesis was right .
Also , a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length .
It kind of wraps things up .
As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic .
Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic .
uder lamp manipulated : lid color
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists .
Rose care about what everyone thinks .
You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container , so the results are accurate .
That is how he organizes the article .
This organization technique is common in information essays .
Invasive species , like the python in the everglades are beginning to threat native species .
Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period .
Paul then decided to do something for Mr. Leonard , and tell him to start his training .
She did not want to hurt her aunts ' feelings by telling her the truth .
Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure .
white : : The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside .
Also , i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor , what is the temperature .
Then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about Space junk .
The author organizes the article by starting with an introduction to get the reader intrested .
According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping .
Based on the student 's data , we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability .
In order to replicate this groups experiments , you would need some additional information .
Mr. Leonard answered I was a good runner but was n't a really good student .
A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used .
They also could have included `` '' record results '' '' in their procedure . ''
Paul said , 'Why ? '
white : : A white doghouse would absorb less energy , an d its temperature would be cooler .
She is working so her brother Paul can go to college .
This makes python generalists & pandas and koalas specialists .
`` a . )
So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read .
While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm .
Pandas and Koala 's eat plants and nothing else , such as as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern .
He knows that even if he ca n't read like everyone else he can still be good at something .
Than the author gives his thesis statment .
The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample .
Paul knows how that feels .
Aunt Kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work .
One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial .
So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint .
light gray : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray .
Also the size of each sample .
Strong .
Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family .
1 ) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length .
he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this .
Paul was very suprised that he did n't tell him .
The main difference between specialists and generalists is that one can adapt and one can not . ''
A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less .
Rose is hardworking , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college . '
Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology .
In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23 .
Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to .
Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane .
In addition , I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used .
Then the chain of amino acids is released .
2 .
The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first .
It seems like he 's been gone for years , ' ( para .
The author let 's the reader know what each part will be about .
In the trials , the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as .
It show when she does not answer her aunt to keep from hurting her aunt 's feelings .
Then , tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome .
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome .
Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star .
This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average .
It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste .
The author organizes this article using passages for different information .
^P 1 .
Pandas in china are similar to koala bears in Australia because they are both specialists .
Both are different from pythons because , pythons are generalists , who can live in most climates . ''
of air in the lab as white does n't attract heat like black does
In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm .
When her Aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this family , she did not reply .
Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard 's past from the high school track coach .
The author uses heading to organize his article .
at 42 degrees celsius
The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention .
first , the aurthor grabbed the readers attention .
After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm .
Also she cares about her family because she does n't want to let them down with writing her essay .
Then , he found out that he had flunked out of college , because he could n't read .
So by stated facts with dates it makes it more interesting .
Also , for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used .
This introduces what his paper will be about .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist .
And realizes that they are a lot a like
They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live anywhere .
The information Paul finds about Mr. Leonard on the website is surprising to him .
I would also need to no how much of each material to use .
He did not expect the man to be famous .
There are several things this group should have included , in their procedure .
This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane .
The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container .
China 's panda Australia 's koala are similar as they are both considered as specialists .
So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard .
Maybe it would n't . '
This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell .
They eat only eucalyptus leaves .
The author starts off the article by catching the readers interest and attention .
The author organizes the article by writing about different topics in a section .
After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment .
A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane .
black : : This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer .
The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours .
They both could n't read .
The last section tells you why it is a big deal .
This is different from a python .
It stretched 22-23mm .
The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner .
Both of these animals need specific food source to survive .
The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections .
It only stretched 10-12mm .
Also the amount of weights you add one .
Finally , we need to know which materials to use .
The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul .
Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before .
I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most .
There is a connection between them .
They do n't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples .
The author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader 's attention .
The Koala 's almost eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
The black lid was average 53 ( DEG ) C. it got hotter because the color was darker .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation is that shes kind .
Paul said , 'But you went to college . '
Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low .
The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most .
Pandas and koalas reguire specific food only found in ther homelands of China and Australia .
Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane .
They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial .
They are different from pythons because pythons can live pretty much anywhere .
The auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
Furst , the author opens with an introduction to grab the readers attention .
In the procedure the samples ' identities are not given .
Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles , and so is Paul .
and Crash Course .
He organizes this article by breaking it up on diffrent topics of the same subject .
A solution is difficult , but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space .
If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree .
However , the light gray lid had an average of 45 ( DEG ) in the tr ials .
This way , the dogh ouse would be around 48 ( DEG ) .
Rose is a young girl in her late teenage years .
To make this experiment 's procedure complete , three additional things are needed .
At the start of the procedure , we would need to know what four samples we were testing .
By stating the length and type of each plastic .
He realizes that someone else had the same difficulties that he is having .
to define and descibe the problem at hand .
They also never listed the materials that needed to be used . ''
The author then closes the article with a good conclusion .
As he imrpoves in the hurdles he is asked to join the track team .
white was on averge 11 ( DEG ) c cooler than black .
This article is very well organized .
They both are good hurdlers , they could n't read , and they felt embarrassed about it .
Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot .
In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly .
Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens .
The problem does not state what the four different samples are .
We would also need a control .
Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested .
Panda bears eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves .
First , the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article .
I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container .
At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage .
One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything .
The background information shown who Mr. Leonard aws in the past .
You would also need to know what type of materials you need .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
When she was talking to her aunt it said 'Rose did n't answer .
One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork .
Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much .
Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3 .
Next , he explains to us just exactly what space junk is and how it gets there .
Invasive in the the article means that any species controling the habitat + endangering other animals is considered invasive .
Second they tell you what space junk is .
They never say .
Osmosis- The diffusion of materials through water particlesActive transport- Moves materials by using energyPassive transport- Moves materials without using energy
which is super hot .
The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items .
Lastly , we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period .
He was the same as Pual .
example : the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar .
white : : The lighter the color , the less air temperature .
It makes Paul think that he is not alone .
For this experiment , I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup .
In order to replicate the group 's experiment I would have to know more information .
For example , pandas eat nothing but bamboo and koala 's eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school .
Considering the plastic was already stretched .
The pandas eat bamboo from China & the Koala eat eucalyptus leaves .
The panda & the Koalas are also both herbovores that eat mainly 1 exclusively plant .
This occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane .
Then the article tells about the crash course .
Startng the article off with some hurmor 'Grab your telescope !
If she did n't she would have ignored Anna and got on her paper .
In the Febuary of 2009 , two satelites , one American and one Russian , bith collided with eachother .
An example with details would be , 'The emotions in Mr.Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
^p b . )
The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age .
Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete .
Paragraph 46 says , ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , I said , walking back toward the school .
You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
He won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuonals , but drop out of college .
Koalas and pandas are both different from pythons have many different places they live in the world .
What is Space Junk ? , Crash Course , ect .
The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic .
It 's a comet !
A second way he could 've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used .
It has several food sources such as the key largo wild rat or even alligators .
white : : I would paint the dog house white .
The second section was about what happens when satellites collide , 'Crash Course ' .
for example ' Grab your telescope !
Material just flow through the cells pores .
The author organizes this article into four main sections .
during her talk with Anna Roes says 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college . '
Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane .
The author organizes this article by starting it off with an interesting scenario .
The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place .
Also , I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials .
Paul wants to be like Mr. Leonard but instead he wants to survive college .
look up in the sky !
The author organizes the article by first letting the readers know what space junk was .
Plastic D could have be stretched .
After reading the groups procedure , I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment .
Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read .
Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life .
There was an indepent variable , the type of plastic , and there were multiple trials .
b ) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material .
Two , how much of each sample is added to each cup .
Pandas in China are similar to koala in Australia because they both herbivores .
( A ) According to the students data .
a .
She cares for her family .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is comforting .
Finally , I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass .
You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples .
In order to replicate the experiment , I would need to know which 4 samples to use .
Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp .
Paul could have helped Mr.Leonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling .
Crash Course talks about how space junk may interfer with spacecrafts and other object .
After that , they tell why space junk is harmful and dangerous .
One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test .
Then he talks about how stuff like this is a big deal .
Many of Rose 's traits are displayed throughout the story .
I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures .
For the plastic C and D , they are inbetween and C is close to A .
Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial .
The first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested .
Translation takes place in the cytoplasm .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college .
What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership .
Then , he has 'Crash Course ' giving examples of previous times there has been crashes in space .
He felt like they had the same flaws and problems .
Others believe those species are truly invasive because they are disrupting the biodiversity of the environment .
Koala 's do much of the same thing .
Dark colors absorb more heat energy .
Pythons eat almost everything and are extremly harmful .
Paul is sempathtic and wants to help Mr.Leonard to read .
Firts starting with an introduction that came with excitment .
In order to replicate this experiment , more information is needed .
The coach wanted paul to excel at something since he could not read .
HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more .
white : : They should use the white color because white does n't heat up as fast .
When all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they mostly eat one thing .
Invasive species refer to animals/species that was introduced to an area it did originally live in .
That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart .
a ) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic .
The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon .
This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna .
It can use endocytosis , to bring substances into the cell , or exocytosis to push substances out .
what are the samples ?
Active transport is the opposite of diffusion .
The third section is what 's going on now with the topic .
'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading .
Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard .
Even the term `` '' invasive species '' '' is unfair '' '' .
First the author starts with an introduction to get your attention .
The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use .
According to the students data the conclusion that plastic .
In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added : ^p 1 ) What are the samples .
'Anna , 'Rose said 'What 's wrong ?
a ) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B , and the least stretchable is plastic A .
The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur .
They start off with explaining what the rest of the article was going to be talking about .
a . )
The pythons though are addapting all over the U.S to different environment unlike the animals above .
A .
These sections describe what 'space junk ' is .
The introduction is very attractive .
The procedure left out some information that is needed .
This set-up provides background information for the readers to clarify the theme .
Paul complies and meets Mr. Leonard in the gym , where a basketball team is playing .
Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid .
The author starts with background information of what space junk actually is and what happens to the junk .
This article is organized in a topical manner .
Finally , He talks about the importance of keeping space clean .
The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand .
In step 1 , they say `` '' determine mass of four different samples . '' ''
He could of bad more trials , and include plastic types in his procedure .
Second , they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar .
Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties .
A .
Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33 .
According to the article , pythons are endangering five species in the Florida in US .
Was each sample poured in to .
He sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing hurdler , and he did n't even tell him about it .
It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard .
The reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding .
He does this with the heading What is Space Junk ?
they have a section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
The author then goes on to talk about spack junk and its path and possible collision course .
`` black : : Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy .
In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure .
When she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care .
He had a difficult time throughout high school and college .
Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary .
If she told her aunt the truth she would hurt her aunt .
What are the four different samples ?
They are different from pythons b/c pythons are generalists who can live in many different habitats successfuly .
The author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them .
2 .
MacInnes believes that the term invasive is unfair because `` '' they 're introduced .
The author begins the article 'Orbiting Junk ' with a comment on something seen in space .
The auther defines the problem , giving an examples of space junk .
That 's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm .
The third section is titled , 'Crash Course ' .
they eat very little .
One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis .
The author writes , 'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Three ways to do this are active , passive , and diffusion .
They organize it into subject matter : 'What IS space junk ?
At the end of the story Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
The author goes on to give background information about the space program .
Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design .
I can see that Rose tries to be positive about life with her sister Anna .
1 ) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation .
The beginning is a introduction or attention grabber to get you ready to read the report/story .
And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water .
...
These both come from plants .
'This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals.You broke records . '
This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane .
These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails .
While these animals share this lifestyle in common , the python contrasts them .
The author did a really good job of writing this article .
The author organizes the article in a way that is almost like a timeline .
I believe they want to show how animals differ with their food source availability .
This means that they can adapt very easily to new environments , whereas , specialists can not .
such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled ( Crash Course ) .
passive transport where the need niether energy or a key
Rose did not reply to her Aunt 's question if she was feeling weighed down for this reason .
An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
With a good hook , to bring readers into it .
She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings .
this could also effect the mass of the material .
a ) From this data , one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it .
Also in the 4th step , it says , to rinse each sample with distilled water .
( line 21 ) Rose nodded .
Osmosis , is the movement of water through the cell membrane .
^p b .
Based on the student 's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable .
It 's time to start your training . ''
Then the full strand is split , and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated .
That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab .
I also need to know how much vinegar is needed .
Mr. Leonard was a track star .
a .
Caring 'Anna ' 'what 's wrong ? '
But if you were to use black or dark gray , it would keep the dog house warmer .
Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second .
Next the author explains the main topic and what exactly space junk is .
He discovered he broke records , and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life .
How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains .
So Paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return .
For example : in subsection What Is Space Junk ? , the author explains exactly what is space junk .
Rose is caring to others , and tries to help them before taking care of her own problems .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star .
Pythons can eat almost anything , and they will eat anything as long as they get their food .
Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most .
The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container .
White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above .
They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting .
'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
The author separates the article into four sections .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard .
Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability .
The author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover .
Paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read .
Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial .
Rose is being thoughful when she does n't tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists .
Then he puts a subtitle on the next subjects he brings up to keep it very organized .
Since Mr. Leonard helped him , he will help Mr. Leonard .
The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him .
After mRNA leaves the nuclues , it goes to ribosomal RNA .
He wanted to show respect and help Mr. Leonard do something too .
The author organizes this article in a way that grabs your attention at the beginning .
The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA .
You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same .
He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate .
This shows how she cares about her sister .
He had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before .
^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers .
Then after it leaves the nucleus , it enters the cytoplasm .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists .
Then , the author describes what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk . '
The background information on Mr. Leonard helps him relate to Paul .
Though it did n't seem like a problem then .
Then with what happens with all this junk and if it carshes .
Unlike the python it relies on many .
It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period .
The author organizes this article in sections .
A .
This shows that she values others and puts them before her personal interests .
`` A ) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least .
When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids .
Their is active transport , passive transport , and then their is gradient transport .
A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon .
After that he explains how space junk is created , which is by free-orbiting satellites crashing into each other .
Paul feels a connection to Mr. Leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1 .
It . ''
First the author grabs the readers attention by talking about a tool bag in the sky .
She tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize .
Thirdly , you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment .
The author begins the article by relating to the reader in a humorous way .
`` A Panda from China is similar to a Koala because they both really on one food source .
He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage .
The author organizes the article by seperating different topics into different sections .
Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume .
I would need the amount of roch in each container .
First , you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers .
The author organized the article by using an introduction what an attention getter to get the reader 's interest .
Animals call this reptiles invasive because they are a non-native species and are essentially invading our country .
Based on her conversation with Anna , one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness .
First , I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container .
Rose is very considerate to the feelings of others .
covers ?
Before he did n't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future .
`` The word `` '' invase '' '' describes how pythons are becoming an invasive species .
The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment .
The author first begins on getting attention and becoming interested in this article .
The author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups .
After Paul got a background check on Mr. Leonard it had really touched him .
He had felt like he had something in common with Mr. Leonard .
Rose is a rather optimistic person .
One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails .
Lastly , I must know where the containers were placed , in the sun , shade , etc .
Which would help the dog stay cool .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him . '
I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours .
The author organizes the article by using subtopics within the topic of the article .
This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school .
The word invasive is particularly important to the article because it describes foreign reptiles in America .
then he talks about how satellites can colide with space junk and be destroyed .
Pandas and koalas are both vegatarians that eat bamboo and/or eucalyptus .
He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard .
The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool .
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning .
In this section it says 'In 1957 the soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite . '
He asked , Why didnt you tell me about this ?
One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container .
Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard ca n't read just like himself .
The author first gives the reader background information on the problem .
At first the author brings you in with starting sentence .
He then tells people about the satellites and what happens to them .
Then the plastic cups will stretch .
This proves that black absor bs the most heat .
I believe they are both different because pandas and koalas are harbivors , and pythons are carnivors . ''
He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read .
In the next paragraph we read about crash courses .
These species brought over are taking place of our own animals .
Also , describe how long the plastic types were before she started her experiment .
They are not natural there and they disrupt natures balance .
a . )
Section two talks about what space junk is .
Also , pythons can sometimes be kept as pets .
'Crash Course ' was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions .
The procedure is missing some critical info .
( A ) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability .
This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident .
Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well could n't read .
Another good thing would be to have multiple trials .
The author starts this article grabbing the attention of his readers .
white : : white would make the dog house less hot .
They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width .
They have actually determine the mass .
`` Based upon the given data , I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability .
a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample .
You feel okay ? '
Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used .
Based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab , the reader can tell that Rose is a caring person .
The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh .
They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was .
As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature .
In it , the author explains how 'space junk ' is concerning government agencies all around the world .
The student should haw used the same length plastic for each .
The author also goes in chronilogical order .
Finally she challenges the reader 's integrity by asking about the seriousness of this to other people .
Paul is greatly influenced by Mr. Leonard 's background information and story of his life throughout college .
Throw away containers .
She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them .
Specialists ca n't seem to come together and agree . ''
He was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student .
The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample .
' , he talks about the malfunctions and how satellites were first used .
A ) Based on the procedure the results were not valid .
So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure .
The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54 ( DEG ) C , the color black .
Paul 's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better .
a ) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic .
This allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped .
The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most .
Finally they discuss how big of an impact this debris can have on our atmosphere and Earth 's surface .
Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do .
During the story , Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a great 400 meter hurdler .
The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star .
Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used .
The most flexible however , was plastic sample B .
A ) In conclusion , plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material .
That is any for f them live here .
After that he breifly explains the space age in what is space junk .
THen going on to say how big of a deal the 'junk ' is .
After the mRNA leave the nucleus , there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis .
When an invasive species is introduced to an environment , it will complete to an indigenrous species food source .
Plastic type 'D ' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested .
After that he tells how this 'space junk ' is formed .
Plastic type B is the most stretchable .
`` In conclusion to this data , I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic .
This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat .
Invasive brings a misconstreud idea of terror to the passage . ''
Thirdly , they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours .
They are unlike pythons , which will eat a more general selection of prey from wood rats to alligators .
The author starts off with an exciting introduction , that very much grabbed my attention .
Conclusion : There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic .
Rose is considerate .
The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container .
The author organizes the artical well .
Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount .
This leads into Little Bits , But a Big Deal .
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in many ways .
The informatioin that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard is about his past career as a college track star .
It holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat nothing but one particular plant .
-
Nor .
Their different from pythons because pythons eat other animals .
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler .
This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot .
The author organizes it into three different sections .
Next , another tRNA connects to the next codon , bringing in another amino acid .
Also what you would use to find the mass .
It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use .
The conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration .
^p b .
It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm .
Only some substances can leave and only some may enter .
On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather .
The anti-codons are joined by amino acids .
This paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous .
Therefore , painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog .
These two things must be done to ensure validity .
To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples .
One trait that describes Rose is understanding .
Mr. Leonard then went on to explain the whole situation and this inspired Paul .
This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him .
Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results .
The students could have done one more trial to justify their results .
the author goes through many diiferent paragraphs and sections .
pandas consume bamboo which grows naturally only in China .
By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard 's past , he feels more accepted and normal .
The text describes a satellite crash that occured in February 2009 .
i say that because , he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did .
That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read .
One way they could have improved was to do another trial .
1 .
They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure .
Paul now looks up to Mr. Leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles .
Finally , I would need to know what type of containers to use ( plastic cups ?
Pandas are similar to Koalas .
This vesicle can now travel into the cell .
The paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there .
Paul was honored for Mr. Leonards help .
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
Mr. Leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what Paul had .
They are very different to pythons which are generalists .
-Also specified how high up the table was .
Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him .
They both very little and they do n't eat meat .
In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
He did n't understand why the coach had kept that from him .
after the readers attention is caught , he explains the reasoning for his introduction .
The two trials confirm this result .
Then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination .
^p 4 ) What kind of containers were used .
The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment .
The pythons are called invasive for their destructive habits of killing off natural wildlife . ''
And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they 're both specialists .
Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples .
Lastly , I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white , apple material .
Rose cares for her family , not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt .
They both had problems reading .
As well as knowing what type of each substance you need .
Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard because he had trouble reading as well .
The explanation includes the background of it , and how it happens .
Panda in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist .
^p ( B ) The student could included more trials to add validity .
They then go into a brief descrption of 'space junk ' .
The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials .
the Australia koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
He wants Mr. Leonhard to do the same he did .
One thing you would need to know is what use of containers you need .
dark gray : : The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm , b ut not too hot .
Also , the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored .
In paragraph 19 , 'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt . '
I also would need to know how large each material is .
Crash Course tells you about some of the recent collisions among satelites and what people have left behind .
Rose did n't answer .
The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth 's atmosphere .
The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard .
To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor .
Third , we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish .
the author splits the artical up into sections each section describing different subjects .
Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him .
In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers .
Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p ( 2 ) Create a T3 and try it once more .
In conclusion , plastic type B stretched the most in both trials .
We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers .
Some additional information you would need a control .
This would provide a constant to compare the results to .
This procedure also should specify what materials to use , line what brand of cups or size .
Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray would n't be too hot or cold .
This process occurs by diffusion .
The author organizes the article by first explaining what the problem is .
Once the rRNA reads a codon , the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4 .
Telling him ' C'mon , Mr. Leonard , ' as they walked back towards the school .
It goes from the cytoplasm to the ribosomes .
I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment ... ' ( 45 ) .
How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using .
Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy .
The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here . '
Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials .
She 's not only worried about herself , but Paul also .
Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure .
However , the article also claims that pythons are generalists .
I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure .
The amount of vinegar could impact the mass .
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is that she is caring .
Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion , osmosis , and endocytosis .
He ws shocked at first because he did n't think that Mr.Leonard could 've ben a track star .
Different weights can cause different results .
These both are different from pythons because like the article says , pythons are a generalist .
Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he was n't a good student .
They could have said how much were n't they used .
Paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased .
D stayed the same .
In the article it say panda 's eat bamboo exclusively and Koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment .
So Paul decides to offer his help and teach Mr. Leonard how to read .
The article starts off with the introduction , then to the section titled 'What Is Space Junk ?
How much vinegar should be poured into cup ?
Comparing it to the others , it streched the furthest .
It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours .
Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass .
Fourthly the say why such a little thing can be a big problem .
The author organized this article by using subtitles like 'What Is Space Junk ? '
They are both similar because they both only eat one thing .
To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using .
One Trait that would describe Rose would be helpful .
In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm .
One trait that can describe Rose is determination .
She did n't want to hurt her aunt .
So we can see how far the plastics stretched , and how many weights were used .
The author organizes the article by first introducing the problem at the beginning and then explaining the matter .
The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample .
Mr. Leonard then tells about how he could n't read , just like Paul .
Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial .
This quote shows China panda 's and Australia 's koala bears are similar because they mostly eat one thing .
For each codon , there is a complementary amino acid .
He had nobody to help him .
For example , do they want us to use the same materials ?
validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2 .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
They have a common problem with reading .
And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark .
Unlike the python who is a generalist who can live anywhere because food is abundant .
Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave .
After that it was time to do homework . '
This paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space .
After all , Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles .
During the story , the reader gets background information about Mr.Leonard .
This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane .
The word `` invasive '' is significant because it separates those are reptile impatalian and was against it .
She seems like she is overwhelmed .
^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them .
And in `` '' Air Temperature '' '' the average temp .
Based on the students data , plastic type D has the most sretchability .
I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample .
One trait of Rose 's is that she is very caring .
In diffusion , substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane .
In the story , Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes .
The average for the temperature was 53 ( DEG ) c for black .
How much vinegar to use .
He starts out telling what space junk is .
During the story , Paul does not know much about Mr. Leonard .
( line 47 ) .
The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something .
Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports .
she goes to school then works 4 hour shifts after school , then helps fix supper .
On hot days the dog would stay cool .
The author opens the article with an intense introduction , but then settles down into a serious tone .
Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands .
Paul takes this information as an encouragement .
Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse .
In the other two subsections , they are once again organized by topic .
And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end .
He started with What Is Space junk , whick explains what he 's talking about .
Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in .
Next , he uses 'Crash Course ' to desribe the possible dangers of space junk in outter space .
The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful .
Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm .
He then writes of how the 'junk ' gets into the atmosphere and who has caused this issue .
Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins .
For example , One section is called 'What is space junk ? '
He goes through the order you need to know things .
The author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of .
I would need to know what size or shape of container to use .
Finally , they need to say at what temperature they should sit ( room temp ) .
Many reptiles such as snakes and lizards have invaded America .
The author starts off light-hearted and keeps getting more serious .
But then he is more understanding as he finds out that he could n't read .
This is what she tries to portray to Anna .
This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it .
Each section has a main focus , but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris .
In order the replicate the experiment you need
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard was such a great athlete .
Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator .
This story can relate to many people .
Type B stretched 22 ( mm ) on the first and 23 on the second .
The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion .
Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him .
^p 3 .
Then he talks about how the space invasion took place .
So they have to stay in specific habitats to survive .
He really connected with Paul when he told he couldnt read .
At the ribosomes tRNA attatches to the appropriate sequences on the mRNA .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
They have to be clear and actually name them also .
Thus , opinions on `` '' invasive '' '' species vary . ''
The first one is called 'What is Space Junk ? '
The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B .
Also , you would need to how to determine mass .
In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first .
He might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together .
The background information has a positive effect on Paul because it reminds him of himself .
Lastly , we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container .
Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested .
Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration .
Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used .
The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul .
The next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the Earth .
A ) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic .
The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used .
The last process is passive transport .
B ) One way the student 's could 've improved their design is by adding a third trial .
In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane .
The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass .
The student could have done more trials or added on more time , for the plastics to stretch longer .
This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant .
second , the author got more serious and showed people actually care about space junk .
The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed .
She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working .
He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment .
Paul was grateful that Mr. Leonard had given his time to help him succeed at something .
a ) Based on the students data I 've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic .
But the Koala and China Panda are specialist animals and they eat plants like bamboo and leaves . ''
She works all the time just to help her brother .
Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna .
The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself .
He first starts out with the introduction to be interesting , to get your attention .
' , consists of information about what 'Space Junk ' actually is .
The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family .
So it can live in a wide variety of places , such as Asia and the U.S .
They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well .
Ex : kitchen wrap , grocery bag , cooking wrap etc .
He then explains other topic like Crash Course and other little things that fly in the air .
The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested .
We see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with Anna .
She also does n't understand why money is so important to her parents .
They did n't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers .
Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container .
Rose is dedicated , but feels pinned down .
Rose also has school , work , and family obligations that she has to take care of too .
The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA .
Both of them are almost extinct .
Also , in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut .
The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times .
Pandas and koalas are similar because they do not favor change a basically eat one food a day .
Caring , Rose asks her sister what is wrong , and if she feels okay .
It should list the 4 types of rock .
When Mr. Leonard explains fully however , Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding .
The author organizes the article with titles .
She is always willing to see what is best for the other person in the relationship .
Also you do not know what the four samples are .
The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat .
Leonard 's words were all too familiar to me .
That 's exactly what happened in February 2009 . '
How much vinegar to put in each container ^p 2 .
How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not .
part , you would n't understand what space junk is in the next two sections .
This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly . ''
He also realized they were similar .
Paul feels like he needs to help Mr. Leonard after what he did for Paul .
^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic .
The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment .
The amounts are not specified .
And finally , the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space .
^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results .
Active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient .
The author then goes into an explanation of what space junk is , and why it poses a threat .
the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions .
Otherwise , the data can be affected without this constant .
Pandas only eat bamboo , and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves .
Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record .
^P B ) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial .
Then they talk about the satellite collision between the Americans ' satellite and the Russians ' satellite .
( a ) Based on the students data , plastic type B is the 'stretchiest ' plastic .
The backrground information shows how similar paul and Mr. Leonard are .
Pandas in China care very similar to koalas in Australia , they 're both a species of specialist .
That is how we get Space Junk .
Now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read .
They invaded the area and altered the natural balance of it .
It 's time to start your training . '
Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA , the strand folds up into a specific protein .
This shows how grateful Paul is .
Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard .
Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school .
Mr. Leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing .
Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm .
In the story it says , 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something .
The mRNA attaches to a ribosome , to begin protein synthesis.2 .
The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container .
^p 2 ) How much vinegar I need to pour .
after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard ca n't read .
Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability .
Rose being nice and not wanting to hurt her aunts feelings did n't give her an answer .
Lastly , they never say how much vinegar to use .
Suddenly I realized what I could do for him .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia they only eat one thing .
China 's panda and Australia 's koala bear both only eat plants .
The first section just explains that there are things in space called 'space junk ' .
Rose does n't want to hurt her family becasue she is caring .
You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample .
The author explains the problem in the introduction and first paragraph .
The length of the plastics need to be kept constant .
The author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand .
At last , he talked about tiny bits of space trash .
In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed .
Paul said , 'Well , what happened after that ? '
And finally , I need to know if it is weighed in grams , pounds or any other measurement .
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records .
^p 3 .
In this type of transport the cell does not use energy .
Paul asks 'Why did n't you tell me about this ? '
They could have improved validity by adding another trial . ''
( 1 ) When mRNA leaves the nucleus , it travels through the cell to a ribosome .
Then to how these satilites can sometimes crash causing debri to scatter .
In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house .
Also they both eat basically the same type of food , bamboo and eucalyptus leaves .
It did n't change in either trial .
It 's a meteor ! ' .
was 42 ( DEG ) C. controlled varible : temp .
They should also say what the sample is .
The panda and the koala both are specialist species .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles .
'It 's time to start your training . '
Roes is caring .
The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening .
' , 'Crash Cource ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat leaves and plants .
The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it .
He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is .
The darker the color of the lid got , the warmer the inside of the jar was .
^p a .
Diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration .
Both trials it had the highest length .
Finally , this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample .
The groups prosedure could use , they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end .
A .
Finally , he explains the importance of space trash and finding a solution to the problem .
Not only that plastic type , B , was the strongest , it stretched the farthest too .
Paul then later finds that Mr. Leonard faced the same trouble in high school .
So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite .
The first section is the introduction , where the author provides a brief explanation of space junk .
I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution .
The author organizes the article by suptitles going from the most improtnant to the least .
.
They also included only the trial . ''
Caring Rose says 'We have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job . '
The word invasive is crutial to understand the article .
How long are we rinsing them ?
Also , the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container .
The author organizes the articles by producing several different titles and layering supporting evidence with facts .
in the jar the lea st
This polymer investigating lacks numerical data .
He wanted to help him learn to read .
The second thing would be to increase the number of trials .
The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers .
You feel okay ? '
Pythons eat other animals , they are carnivores .
Paul states , 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals .
Thirdly , how do we determine the mass of the samples ? ''
The author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose .
You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed . ''
I believe by organizing it this way it leads to a more effective and more interesting article .
Also , you would need to know what type if container to use .
Then he begins explaining how it is a bad thing that it is there .
Paul takes Mr. Leonard to teach him to read at the very end of the story .
Start off paragraph six with a little story about free orbiting space junk .
The information gives Paul motivation to never give up on school or athletics .
' , 'Crash Course ' , and 'Little Bits , But a Big Deal ' .
Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials .
The author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line .
At the same time Paul could relate to him .
They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists . ''
The author organizes this article by breaking it up into four parts .
In conclusion , The author is just making it easier to understand .
All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had , Paul had the exact .
^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
white : : Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite .
Paul feels that Mr.Leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either .
Also how much vinegar to put in the container .
He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run .
First , we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers , enough to cover them ?
In active transport , the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane .
1 .
This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color .
A python will eat anything from a key largo wood rat to a common house pet .
1 .
In line 40 , Paul asks 'Well , what happened after that . '
Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment .
