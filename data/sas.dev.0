The first major step is intersphase which get the body started .
Pythons can live in a third of the continental United States .
It finally occurrs to her that she can write her essay over her life style .
May be its because she does not want her sister to worry .
One proccess used by cells is diffusion were the food is slowly allowed to pass through the membrane .
transcriptionreplicationtranslation
Lastly , another way the cell controls movement is by ribosomes .
the flagellim is used to cause the organism to move about .
Panda 's only eat bamboo , which means they are harmless .
You need limestone , wood and plastic , marbles .
transcription , translation
They do n't want this because those animals will gain predators and not be invasive any more . ''
The difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in .
the mRNA is translated in to amino acidsthe codons take their placeand the new sequence is finshed
The mRNA sends the protein to tRNA .
The three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are mitosis , meiosis , and passive .
I dont know wat invasive is .
It seems like he 's been gone for years . '
The proteins are part of the process and the ribrosomes are what helps it too leave the nucleus .
The species named invasive species would most likely mean an animal/pet that is generally not normal to won .
Coci is a movement that the cell uses to move all around .
It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him about his past .
There not invaded because they were introduced .
white : : I pick this color because its so bright .
light goes in .
Two the rate at which and finaly they are very hard to extinct .
Tails
Record your data .
'Do you feel so weighed down by what you 're doing to help this family ?
The author uses somthing that would catch somone 's attention .
Example is that when her brother gets out of college she said he will take care of us .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus it codes for
they let things in and out .
1. the mRNA leavcs the nucleus2 .
This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with .
The 3 processes used by cells to control movement are osmosis , diffusion and active transport .
movement , reproduction , and respiration .
Gaining more control for the cells .
Although the nucleus controls the cell and tells it to move the membrane does most of the work .
mRNA , translation
He organizes it by bits of information .
In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1 .
They both have an issue with reading and learning well .
The cell membrane has holes in it for proteins and enzymes to pass through .
The endoplasmic reticulum moves the ribosomes into the nucleus .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their both some type of bear .
Paul was asked to gym
Rose is very blunt with Anna .
The body then performs protien synthesis .
Instead of saying anything , she just nodded and her aunt already understood .
There are cells to transport protiens.2 .
She was angry but very miss understanded .
Though a small opening that only aloows certain thing to come in .
Then , the author explains why it 's important to know what he is telling you .
Interphase , Metaphase , Anaphase and Telophase .

She wants her family to be happy even if she is not .
Three processes used to control cell movement are ,
REPRODUCING , GROWNING , AND LIVING SPACE
It makes it seems like the species are introduced as it says in the article .
the article is put togoghter by a the perosn that does the all the finaling to the paper .
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the sequence to the cytoplasm .
Also are seen through their fear .
After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample .
First the nucleus would go through Metaphase .
Pandas in china and Australia 's koala leaves almost one country .
Rose likes to caarry the weight of the world on her shoulders .
The word invasive means that something or someone is or wants invade a parson place or thing .
1. they could build up ane enzyme to help protect the cell2 .
We have to know the starting mass , the ending mass and the difference in mass .
A pythons swallowed an alligator. `` ''
This describes what MacInnes is doing .
MITOSIS , PROPHASE , AND METAPHASE
About the space and the ships and how they are made and all that kind of stuff .
Also invasive is about the whole world so it realates to evestone and could affect everyone .
Then the organelle makes a protein that the body needs and sends it to were it is needed .
the cytoplasm which caries it on the substance .
ficiliated difusion
Then it copies itself again .
Then the rRNA comes along .
They have no arms or legs , they 're predators , and etc .
white : : they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light .
First starting at the mRNA it goes to tRNA , which transfers it to rRNA and then gRNA
mRNA , tRNA , rRNA
The snakes did n't invade anything they were introduced .
Also for you to not be able to move around .
It does n't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation .
There different from pythons because , they ca n't eat almost anything like a python .
He questions him about it , he wants to know why he stoped .
He is one of the select few of the remedial program .
Transcription , Transition , Conjugation , and tRNA .
the consentration gradiant is when the partical move from higher consentration to lower consentration .
The significance in the word invasive is that in this article this is the most used word .
She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person .
' I 'm fine , ' her sister said .
Also , by listening to her Aunt Kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier .
( Paragraph 11 )
I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water .
light gray : : it can effect the ray of the sun
Cells are crazy3 .
It then splits to opposite sides.3 .
Rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone .
`` a ) Plastic `` '' D '' '' length did not increase or decrease in both trials .
Towards the end of the essay , 2009 is mentioned and more modern times and issues are disscussed .
Where as pandas and koalas can not .
Rose had a dream that Paul was holding her down .
Her dream of Paul 's body weighing her down underwater exemplifies this .
that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
1.how big the openings are in the membrane .
It says invasive is just passing judgement . ''
Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself .
The panda eats bamboo and the koala eats leaves .
It 's a tool bag ? '
The cell need to grow and divide or else it would become to big and explode .
Lysomoes3 .
`` Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they eat plants .
Then he starts with the history of space accidents , and starts to describe the harmfulness of orbiting junk .
NucleousMembreneRibosomes
Anna wants to mean that Rose start to think and talk like her mother .
That holds the message that the DNA gave the mRNA .
Rose is clearly open and feels her Aunt is trustworthy .
duplication , translocation , replication , mitosis
Prophase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase .
Then tRNA makes a copy of the mRna and sends it out into the cell .
Meosis3 .

he sees that mr. leonard used to be a track star
Paul was sad for the caoch because the caoch had to quit running because of his grades .
With protein synthesis , first the mRNA leaves the nucleus .
osmosis , mitosis , and meiosis
Once the rRNA is done getting the message it takes it .
rRNA then takes the information to the center of all the protein synthesis .
Maybe it would n't .
not enof info to tell what you are asking for
The golgi apparatus acts as a transportation system of protiens in a cell by importing and exporting the proteins .
That the once clear space has been filled with junk orbiting the earth .
This means it went farther .
This is the fourth phase
She works hard at school and she helps out her family .
black : : Really black .
`` The word invasive makes the animals seem like they are taking over the word .
It tells Paul that he can do something that is worth his time and effort .
One trait that Rose is dealing with is poverty .
Finally determine the mass of each Example .
It goes through the chain and then goes throuth the atp synthase then it comes out of the transport chain
Pandas & koals cant .
You would need to add observations , you would also need to add the time on the table .
She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better .

White blood cells fight off diseases .
mRNA tRNA rRNA
rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
For example the python is an invasive species in the U.S .
He fineds out that Mr.Leonard it really not what he thinks he is .
It 's a meteor ! '
Rose has a lot of stress and responsibiltiies .
She does n't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much .
The first process is miosis.The second is
Through regeritationThrough blood flow Through urination
When Anna came in to the kitchen at the start of the story Rose asked , 'Whats wrong . '
Diffusion is one processes used by cells to cntrol movement across the cell membrane .
The mitocondrian surve to maximize cellular reperation by increasing cellular communication .
'You sond just like Mama ' .
Protein synthesis is completed when the mRNA leaves the cell .
While on the other hand pythons are generalist .
Basically it is mentioned because some people think this animals are invasive species .
blood flows and thats all i know
The author arganized the righting using information he knows , and gathered about the junk in space .
The cell sends out a part of itself and the rest follows .
1 .
white : : It wont be as hot for the dog .
She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her .
I think that 'invasive ' is passing judgement .
Vacoles-are organelles that help control excessive water and substances being moved around the cell membrane.3 .
^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min .
D stood the same .
Sending ribosomal messages .
In the story the author wrote `` '' invasive creatures '' '' meaning being dangerest creaturs . ''
The author organizes the article in cornilogical order
Ribosomes- shape the mRNA into a protein decoding what it says to know what the proteins job is .
movement
From there it goes through a cycle and
active transport osmosisdiffusion
1. the DNA turns into mRNA.2.then the mRNA turns into tRNA3.the cycle happens over again
( different prosseces are created )
Samples have lost in for mation because , iget information .
they control the movement across the cell mambrane by taking control of each individual part of the cell .
mRNarRNA- ribosome gRNA-genetRNA-transfer

In conclusion , based on the students data there are four different type of plastic .
And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2 .
If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
-enzymes-protein-amino acids
The mRNA must copy its self
from year to year .
In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone .
The nuclues controls all of the actions .
gaudine audine and thauoine
It makes Paul curious .
It leaves the RNA strand and then moves to the cell ...
He explains all the stuff in space and all the things that could happen .
The mRNA is also known as the messenger RNA .
Some people say invasive species are not harmful .
Next the protein will code for different things .
It seems Mr. Leonard and Paul have some history .
needed to replicate this experiment
^p 5 .
The tRNA brings the complementary strands .
Into diffrent articles relating one another by same subject , but discussing diffrent matters
Translation , obsorbs food .
diffusion , crossing over , active diffusion
Then it is coped using tRNA and made into a serparate strand using rRNA .
In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm .
Rosa is always busy she never has time to do anything .
1 .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas because the both only eat plants .
She has so much to do in so little time .
I believe that Rose had the trait to endure .
resperation absorbtion intakeexpulsion
first they have to be a substance that the cell requires .
He makes you interested in the story right away .
Invasive means that the animals will just attack and not second ges itself .
`` `` Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes .
Then the protein will help the cell function right .
They are diffrent from pythons because pythons eat whatever is around if they are hungry .
) And the cell can just allow something in side it .
The sample materials should be marble , limestone , wood , and plastic .
The movement of substances has to make its way through the cell membrane .
CELLS USE THE CELL MEMBRAIN TO MOVE AND SOME CELLS USE THERE FLUGELAM TO SEM AND USE IT TO SWIM
Prophase , anaphase , and metaphase
^p A ) Polymer Investigation .
It bases all of the arguments in the letter half .

Aunt Kolab : 'Do you feel so weighd down by what you 're doing to help this family ? '
Paul also wanted to know why he kept it from him .
In the chart after the article it shows the population of reptiles in the U.S .
NSR
She thinks its all about money.Anna glared at Rose .
You will probably need more of a little bit of everything .
In 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite .
When aunt Kolab was talking to her she was thinking that she could use that topic for her essay .
Another way to control the movement is by diffusion .
One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be Conflicted .
no other school wanted a runner who could n't read . )
When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did .
Afterwords it transports the information to genes .
They are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to Los Angelous for his work .
Last , I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment .
The students could of lable the chart better than the did .
The author organizes tthe article in a tragic to not .
The author organize the article by grabing the reader ettention in the essy .
flagellun , cell membrane , cell
ANAPHASE , PROPHASE.METEPHASE , AND TELEPHASE
However as the story progresses we continue to show that Mr.Leonard cares about what happens to Paul .
Was there a controlled part of this experiment .
Just like Paul .
Four major steps that are involved in protien synthesis are fermentation , lactic acid , transfusion , and transduction .
She see 's things through her eyes and through the eyes of others .
and
When it is there it then startes to break down and turn into protein .
Amino takes proteins to get them read .
Strong , she does n't complain but she is willing to accept help .
There is active transport , passisve transport , and diffusion .
Yes '
The word invasive is significant because it is a passing judgement .
This differs from the python which is a generalist .
One example would be when the python ate a crocodile .
Shes going to school .
A protien attatches to the mRNA and makes a copy of it .
My conclusion is trials ( T2 ) stretched better than ( T2 ) .
mRNA leaving the nucleustRNArRNA
The cell wall blocks and keeps substances from crossing into the membrane
And they know what to do .
Anna makes a point that money is not everything .
The postion of the cell sometimes wont let the cell move.2 .
The third movement is when substances go through using proteins .
Sincere .
We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
In reproduction the cell produces offspring .

The third step would be building a proactive life span .
Considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome 'obstacles ' in his life .
meiosis3 .
A trait that Rose can be described by is realistic .
The cell copys the rna strand2 .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they eating things that they normally dont eat .
grab your telescope !
Need to follow the procedure , also need to know them too .
Osmosis , Active transport , and Facilitated disfusion
Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled .
! And she doesnt have an attitude problem , and she loves her little sister !
The word invasive is signifigant because it shows how important the python situation is to the country .
The information effects Paul because Mr. Leonard ca n't read and neither can Paul .
In the conclusion , the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1 .
The first step involved with protien synthesis is activation .
The mRNA sends a message to tell the body what protein to make.2 .
In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm .
This process is called hypotonic .
The color will change lighter .
1 .
Also , they could of used heavier weights .
Such as them to using bout pythons being invasive creatures .
They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists , they do best around humans .
He catches the readers attention
The word invasive is used to describe the reptiles that are spreading in the story .
The one trait would have to be honesty .
I think one trait that describes Rose is that she sounds like her mom .
All three of the processes help control movement .
Attaching to a strand of DNA .
When the article explains that they arnt .
tRNA gives the rest of the sequence.3 .
When mRNa leaves the nucleus , there are four major steps involved for protein synthesis .
Flagella- helps the cell move .
Its like a security guard in the white house .
The cells use the mitochondria to move things across the cell membrane .
Goes through the cell membrane .
Anna is attempting to confide in Rose , but Rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself .
They transfer the DNA .
He soon found out that Mr. leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it .
When her and her sister talk in the kitchen and get in a fight .
And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life .
into and out of the cell
When she explains to Ana that 'He had to go .
Paul would never question Mr. Leonard or make rude comments because Mr. Leonard was too stern .
An example is when she says , 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college .
The golgi body sends out the dna the mitrocondria is the power house ?
amino acids help build protein and sugars for atp
She wants to be a rock for her sister .
The organelle then reads the infornmation and makes proteins .
And panda 's and koalas eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves . '' '' ''
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track runnner who won nationals and broke records .
It transfers the protein
A cell membrane is whem the cell are attack the membrane for the cell to move thought the membrane .
Pour vinegar in each of 4 separate but identical containers .
After that it turned out that Mr.Leonard didnt learn how to read either .
The cell membrane selects what can and can not cross into the cell .
Mutations occure .
The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight .
Her conversation with Aunt Rose verifies this .
Panda eat almost nothing but bamboo but Koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers .
I just thought that it ment different/others . ''
From the reproduction there are more cells now4 .
In he nucleus , DNA replicates .
Rose did n't want to answer because she was prepared to take care of the family .
I think the effect on Paul is huge .
Metaphase3 .
osmosis , diffusion , mitosis
The genetic material is transcribed into RNA form3 .
Telaphase is where the cell divides .
in my oppion i think that the author is putting the article from lest immportant to most immportant
she never really enjoyed the paper but she set her mind to it .
^p 3 Try more than one type of acid , besides vinegar .
Diffusion
they use there body movments
He has it organised to what subject he turns to .
What happened to his big chance in a good carer ?
Rose has a helpless attitude .
I dont think his stretchability investigation work .
One way is the golgi apparatus , another is mitochondria , and the third is mRNA .
The next step is RNA enters the body .
The pandas eat bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
Rose only nodded .
The RNA goes through a ventricle and makes ATP
The golgi aperatis acts as the bodies UPS man to transport material.Flagela is used by certain organisms to move .
That Mr. Leonard was a Collage track super star and he broke records .
to transfer RNA
shes kind of snoby
If The Dog House Was whiteAnd It was a sunny day , then the dog would be hot .
production , energy ,
Rose said that she does worry about it .
But do n't have to find the mass between each object .
not only in college but also in life .
For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same .
mRNA leaves the nucleus , proteins evolve from amino acids .
For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point .
cell wall- it prevents things from coming in and going out .
I 'd need to know what to lable the containers .
1 ) water is carried throughout the cell
She is constantlydoing something to help , wether it be school or family .
1 ) Cellular Respirtaion 2 )
A triat of Rose 's is that she is a queit person .
she stood and stalked out
The cell membrame , the nucleus , and the cell wall .
*It moves nutrients to other parts of the body .
meiosis3 .
The proteins are then sent to the areas of the body that they are needed in .
it then goes to the golgi apparatus
Invasive is like the same animals but different body parts .
After 24 hrs remove the samples from the container and rinse each w/ distilled water .
Then goes to ribosomes .
Lizards and snakes usually are as a threat to us , because they ar n't common .
He lost his scholarship and flunked out of school .
For example plastic type A first .
it travels3 .
5 ) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types .
The China 's panda and the Australia 's koala are a specialist .
It made him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard since he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college .
The mRNA leave and then sends the material throughout the cell , it contains the proteins and amino acids .
That Mr. Leonard was a really good athlete but he was n't the greatest student .
Frustrated
They are natural unbreeded reptiles . ''
I can tell that she is very open minded about things that she has to say !
Anna hates that her father is gone , and Rose seems to think it was all for the better .
mRNA turns into Dna
respirationmovement of foods and protiens in and out of the cell
mRNA instructs the protien
When it is done there the protein then goes throughout the entire cell .
They help move the substances across the cell so they can pass through the cell membrane .
Which means they can live anywhere unlike specialists .
The four major steps are prophase , metaphase , anaphase , and telophase .
Another one is that the cell has cytoplasm that holds all the things together in the cell .
Cells use different organels inside the cell to move substances across it .
Put on apron & goggles .
telophase prophaseanaphase
The RNA leaves the the nucles by exiting the membrane form their the cell wall ... ..
They have layers which regulate what can enter and exit the cell membrane .
The oxygen moves through the cell to the nucleus .
ONE TRAIT IS HER WAY TO DEEL WITH PAIN OR EMOTIONS .

When Anna is complaining about her Father , Rose soothes her being as gentle as possible .
When talking to Aunt Kolab , the author states ; ' Rose kept nodding .
Rose feels tied down by what she is doing to help her family .
She usually nods and gives jestures .
then you get tRNA then DNA

Mrs. Leonard did n't want him to go to the reading center .
Active transport is the processes of moving acrossed the membrane by the membrane being selectivly permeable .
It is in other words arranged in order of increasing detail .
'It 's only been four months , ' Rose said as gentily as she could .
Interphase 2 .
If its bad they willl destroy it.3 .
They use nuclear envelope which is the processing center of the cell .
1. finding the protiens2 .
The cell wall processes the movement in and out of the cell .
They can move by using permability .
Add how much each plastic streched .
Anna got mad at Rose and stormed off .
The pandas eat bamboo & koala 's in eucalyptus leaves .
The endoplasmic reticulum carries things through the cell .
So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup .
It can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell .
She dont pay attention too anna , and anna dont pay attention too her .
She 's worried because she has to write a three thousand word essay .
white : : The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors .
One of the three proccesses is when the cells travel through the blood flow .
Snakes eat mice and other things that are etable for them .
I say this because in the data table light gr ay 's average temp .
They start of with comments and then start withthe facts .
They both do best around humans too .
There are cells to transport energy .
One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking .
Pandas are similar to koalas because they both are specialist species and they both eat very little .
'Rose did n't answer . '
Based of the plastic are T1 , T2 their amount stretched ( mm ) .
the first thhing it does is travel .
Two strands of RNA are made .
The cell membrane gets the message and tells the cytoplasm to start to push things around.3 .
they can move across water .
metaphase- slows it down to create the processtelaphase-speeds it up to create the process .
The cell membrane is made of material which only nonpolar organisms can pass through .
then hes ilitereatc
the cell uses ribosomes to move substances across the cell membrane .
Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it .
transportation
In the story 'Gifts ' Paul has trouble reading .
It leaves and goes back to the nuclueus and creates the correct proteins with the codons it has .
I 'm a human so I 'm considered a generalists and I favor change .
They are connected to the membrane so that they can controll movement.2 .
1 .
The author organizes this article in a smart , and strategic way .
white : : That color might affect the doghouse , because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse .
Cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell .
Mr. Leonard have to look at the background of paul .
`` The word invasive carries negative connotation .
Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college .
She is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do .
Pythons are carnavores they need meat , they will eat anything dead or alive .
1 .
Pythons are carnivores , so they eat many different kinds of meat .
The background information saddens Paul because Mr. Leonard never told Paul about his background .
black : : black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
Like snakes , alligators and lizards are all from the reptile species .
b ) 1 .
It ate a alligator one time and blew up .

More you could repete the expierement just see it .
Anaphaase .
The genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus .
mitosiosmieosis
She seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks , 'whats wrong ?
Then there is metaphase which brings in the nurtients .
Reflection
First the protein is made , then it forms .
Invasive is basically an assumption on certain species , such as pythons , crocodiles , certain turtles & lizards .
In paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect .
Now there is two sets of the same protien .
they could create an easier passageway
It 's a very strong word .
Golgi Bodies for packaging waste products .
Flagella are used for movement by the cell .
Staying up late working on school work to get in finished for the next day .
Mr.Leonard is a hall monitor and Paul has known him since middle school .
Rose is conflicted .
To get food the nucleas .
The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from .
black : : i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
It 's almost like she is looking for attention .
Rose could be described as lazy because she does n't want to work .
She is very smart and knows what she is talking about .
stressed.she cupped her hands .
they are tRNA , nRNA ,
Transportation so the cell can move particles across the plasma membraneHomeostacis so the cell can do its job normally
Then he explains in more detail what else is in outer space .
If i had to show one trait from Rose it would be based the conversation with Anna .
tRNA , rRNA , transcription , translocation , transference
They do not come in contact with one another.3 .
Pandas and koalas are both similar when it come to eating almost nothing .
Rose seems to go along with what other people have to say .
I think invasive is passing judgement . '' '' ''
The word invasive is very important in this article .
goes to the tRNA tells it what it needs.2 .
Her Aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family .
Unlike pythons who eat everything if their hungry .
And little tenticles on outside of cell to help swim around .
The nuclues is the brain of the cell and it controls what goes on inside the cell .
Making the protein .
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a really good athlete and went to college but he flunked out .
They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart .
Interphase3 .

Endure Rectal
The other things they use is a cell wall , of course only in plant cells .
The panda eats bamboo and the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
With proteins , they are able to give you the needed amount of energy .
They are different from pythons because pandas and koalas are specialist species and pythons are general .
and should be able to keep all his stundents , and his job .
RRNA is later fixing together the protiens .
He obeys the comands form his hall monitor , but there was no relationship formed .
Then the tRNA transports enzymes to be converted .
By good details .
It also detects what is suppose to get into the cell .
'Her voice sank to a fierce whisper . '

They organize the story by date and years , the past events and events that happen now
She understands how important school is
The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen .
Then telling what they are .
Then they use metaphase to come togteher .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia .
^p ( B ) I do n't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment .
Anna is a dreamer , not in a sense of sleep , but of ambitions .
there are a lot of junk in space .
One process by which cells move substances across the membrane is the movement of RNA .
it helps to keep muscles storng .
The cell membrane protects the cell .
Rose is open minded .
it moves to other side .
I think shes just feelin alot of pressure with all that shes doing .
Mr. Leonard had troubles in highschool , just like Paul does .
Difusion is the movement of water through a permeable membrane .
Then they put up a cell wall and put chloroplast around the outside of the wall .
After mRNA leaves the nucleus the next step would be for it to deliver the information it is carrying .
mRNA-which is the messenger , tRNA-which transfeers all of the information , rRNA-replicates the DNA , gRNA
Invasive means domer meaning in the article as referred invasive species meaning dangerous species .
After that is when the membrane get the information .
mRNA tell instructions to the messenger tRNA makes proteins and oxygen and hydrogen
the cyoplasm4 .
She tries to do her best to keep the family going .
The cell uses mitochondria on the cell membrane to move substances across .
A TRAIT THAT ROSE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS HER PROBLEMS AND TO REASSURE OTHERS .
anaphase , metaphase , telaphase , they keep repeating these steps plus one more step
Cytoplasm3 .
The a , c , g , u is a thing that has RNA for the telephase .
By starting back in the 1950 's also by their thoughts an other people thoughts..
He wanted to know more because he asks , 'Well , what happened after that ? '
After that , he/she gives some examples of what has happened over the years which makes up these problems .
This is the significance of the word invasive in the article . ''
'That she was under stress and her mother was working late .
Even thou she is just a child she thinks as an adult .
^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate , but different containers .
Then the cell stores the proteins and uses them .
It leaves the nucleus .
aniphase , telephase , metephase , and prophase
The copy is the same sequence , but it is the opposite sequence .
After the mRNA leaves the nucles it goes through four major steps involved with protein synthesis .
osmosis
From the least dangerous , to the most dangerous things of space junk .
They could of extended the time .
1. mRNA transfers the message2 .
Messenger uses the cell to give messages or instructions to the ribosomes from the nucleus .
Flagella is one of the three processes .
Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation .
it goes from mrna to trna ro rrna to rna
guilty 'Rosa did n't answer .
the author gose in order with what relly happens
They are also similar because they only eat one kind of specific food .
When you permit to buy something you suppose to debate about that .
RNA stand for ribo nucleicacid.DNA stand for dioxiribo nucleicacid .
The flag lets it know where to enter .
Next , I would need tape and markers to label the containers .
I 'm guessing the word invassive means a reptile , animals that many people do n't have . ''
The rRNA carries out the instruction with the amino acids .
TRANSPORTATION , EVOLUTION ,
The first step is when the messenger RNA replicates .
In the story Aunt Kolab says 'Hmm .
They use translation , transcription , and replication .
her younger sister walked in rubing her eyes and rose said what is wrong
Then he goes into detail about how the junk even got in space , and what the junk was .
the nucleus controls everything , the mitochondria tells wat enters and leaves the cell .
`` `` A generalist is a raccoon , a python '' '' . ''
mRNA leaves ... ... .organelles appear ... ..mutation starts ... ... the mitochondrian is working harder ... ...
I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe .
A reptile or a warm climate animal .
She goes to school , goes to work , and worries about finishing her essay assignment .
The author believes that there needs to be less material in space .
Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus one step involved in protein synthesis would be speclization .
Gives information about how serious this situation is .
He has talents that he doesnt know he had .
Then it takes it to the tRNA3 .
Rose is a person thet tries to keep her family together through rough times .
Mr.Leonard was suspicious about what the narrator was doing .
'Grab your telescope !
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' is very significant in the article .
Place a sample of one material into one container and label .
prophase metaphase anaphase telephase
China 's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and Australia 's koala bear eats eucalyptus .
' I fell asleep working on my essay , ' Rose said .
Mrna leave the nucleus going to tRNA .
Another is passive transportation .
Finally , the codons are linked and you have a protein .
When Anna asked her what she feeling okay .
I believe that cobras are the same but in this case were the pray instead of bamboos and leaves .
Last , is the membrane which is the control center of the cell .
Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life .
Anaphase3 .
THE PROTIEN IS TRANSFERD
He tells some problems with them as well .
Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened .
Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are different than pythons because a python is a generalist .
Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things .
Imaginative because she thought of that dream .
The cell membrane regulates what goes in and out of the cell .
Cells choose what to let in .
the ER , the nucleus , and the cytoplasm .
'Rose did n't answer .
After it forms then it starts to make the protein .
The endoplasmic reticulum also moves the substances around .
Despite her exhaustion and discouragment , Rose patiently encourages her sister .
Her mother and father , and even herself after school for a four-hour shift .
proteinprotein is let off into the bodyprotein increases the bodies energyprotein causes the body to stay in shape
feeding the cells .
tRNA gives the amino acid to the protien .
white : : White affects the dog house temperature becau se it has less heat obsorbing in it .
1 .
Pythons , on the other hand , will eat almost anything to survive .
But at the end he just wanted Paul to be a good person .
Rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things .
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is jelous of Paul .
`` `` which mean they will have support and more respect .
Osmosis , the equilzation of water in and outside the cell.2 .
The four major steps of protein synthesis is anaphase , telophase , prophase , and interphase .
It then distconect from the DNA .
Then tRNA takes that over to the chromomes and they corss over .
I still dont believe that 's the right word to use them . ''
When Paul had found out information about Mr. Leonard it effected him strongly .
The cytoms go to the opposite ends of the cell membrain .
This must be difficult for you .
She told Anna that ' I 'm fine , I just had another bad dream . '
Invasive means something that 's not stay able enough to be around society and around other dirred things .
Even the term invasive species is unfair they introduced .
There 's passive somethings and active somethings in the cell membrane .
tRNA transfers it which makes a protein .
They 're are introduced .
They carry itwiggle it accrostglide it
In the story , Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream .

Diffusion moves water into and out of the membrane .
Proteins or the movement of proteins through special small tubes in a cell 's membrane .
Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus , it makes its way through the cell and to the mitocondriton .
As the article said , '' '' introduced '' '' may be a word better for it . ''

the nucleus tells where each individual needs to go .
then it moves to transcription
Mrna leaves 2 . )
The author organizes this article pretty straight forward .
The cell membrane lets stuff in and out .
The second stage is the mRNA getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new .
There are millions of cells in your body , working to fight iff infection.Cells help keep you healthy .
I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples .
`` The significance of the word `` '' invasive '' '' is passing judgement .
Some do it very well .
She is writing an essay for the state competition .

And how she says about traveling to Sacramento to recieve a prize .
And if there 's anything that i Should n't use in this experiment .
The author organizes this article in a way that the atomosphere seems crucial to our planet .
It goes to the nucleus .
Lysosomes , which come from the Golgi apparatus , carry out sugars .
There different from pythons because pythons live in warm climate weather .
Pythons are generalist .
Then it gets more sugars to multiply the strands .
After check if their prediction was right or not .

Rose is a strong person .
He could not read .
The author organized the article by stating the problem .
They guide it .

He wants to be like Mr. Leonard and be a track star .
She acts like her mom and says the same things .
It also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out .
Maybe her life would get easier .
The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer .
white : : dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
I think the the significance of the word invasive means like amazing cage animals , species , reptiles .
It just multiplies , and then that means there is more and new dna .
He helped Paul practice hurdles .
Celluar respiration .
Third , the process is slowed down and anticodons are brought to the mRNA .
That Anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done .
He goes step by steps .
As for the koala and panda they eat certain type of food that can only found in that habitat .
Then the lysosomes take the protein and keep them with other proteins that have been packaged .
Koala 's eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus .
Before they were endangered , but now they are n't . ''
There is also cytoplasm that helps the control .
The article informs the reader of the spread of invasive species . ''
He wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work .
Diffusion carries everything the cells need across the cell membrane and balances the waste products .
I felt that he went in order by years and important things that he thought we needed to know .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas because they can survive in the same climate .
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because of the climate and environment .
My proof of this is ' I fell asleep working on my essay , '
movement reproduction transportation
They are both specialist .
Cell Resperation

`` `` They 're introduced . '' ''
They eat rats , mice , beck one try 'd to eat a crocodile .
TRNA which is transfer RNA .
After you determine the mass of the products , go back and see of your thesey was correct .
I supose that invasive has a strong meaning behind itself . ''
the nucleus is the brain of the cell and controlls where it goes .
This is because after Anna says 'Money is n't everything . '
Cells divide , carry oxygen to the brain , deliver nutrents
after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the
Invasive basically means rare .
The second step would be protecting from viruses .
ONE :
Invasive is to invade and possibly take over and adapt of area .
slides over nucleus makesa new cell
Invasive meaning like very dangerous to others .
But Mr.Leonard could help him
The koala eats eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat only bamboo .
The relay messages .
Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him .
The three processes are diffusion , cell movement , and also cell mutation .
Also record the ending mass , and the difference in mass .
The students still need to make a hypothesis , a graph and find the difference in mass .
Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g .
Also pythons are considered to be an `` invasive '' species by some .
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him .
The effect that background information has on paul is that he is not a very good student in school .
Finally it is returned to the nucleus .
They go to where their function is needed .
`` Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the both only eat one thing .
According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable .
Pythons on the other hand , can eat several different animals and not just one like pandas and koalas .
The three mitocondria , amino acids , and dna
light gray : : the dog will might sleep on the doghouse .
Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard did n't tell him that he was a college track superstar .
There mad that their mom has to work so late .
But pythons eat almost anything that moves and they are harming the enviornnent .
The cell membrane controls how substances move across the cell .
A : ) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs .
breacking them down op
he remembers back when he was doing that in highschool .
they all do there job
it goes to tRNA then to Rna itself
`` The word `` '' invasive '' '' would mean to invade I guess . ''
So in this story it talks about fast changing animals .
The panda eats bamboo and the koal bear eate 's eucalyptus leaves .
`` The significance of the word `` '' invasive '' '' is wrong .
He gradually gets more in depth of what space junk can do no matter what the size .
Substances go through the cell .
Invasive could be meaning that the pythons could be dangerous .
OSMOSIS
Followed by , ribosomes that make proteins .
Pythons and lizards are in peoples houses as pet .
She does n't want to appear vulnerable or weak so she does n't share her true feelings with Anna .
Well pythons can eat mice and other little animals .
A python swallowed an alligator .
He fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read .
1the flagellum2 .
This must be difficut for you .
mRNA takes it to the brain .
The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard seems to discourage him .
That 's when protein synthesis is formed
pandas eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves .
The cell membrane has 3 processes that it has.1 . )
leave the nucleaus.envelope disapears
In other word `` '' invasive is saying the new kinds of pet are n't wanted . ''
Paul couldnt read just like Mr. Leonard , but Paul has more help then Mr. Leonard did .
anaphase , metaphase , prophase , and telaphase
Anaphase : the parent cell is going through a process of division .
It was mostley in order and never of the topic or the paragraph .
dark gray : : AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
Cells Use tails to move .
When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her .
As you can tell pythons are way more dangerous . ''
mRNA , tRNA ,
Mr. Leonard was a great track athelet when he was in college .
When mRNA leaves the nucleus , there are four major steps that are involved in protein synthesis .
Difusion , and osmosis .
When they are called invasive it makes it seem like snakes are not wanted , bad and should die .
That she wants to be free .
He 's telling you to go outside and look at every thing floting around into space .
After that , they must duplicate .
Put each sample into 4 different containers .
That paul did n't really know about sports that well .
Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials .
This show show they are both stable .
When Rose looks at her situation at a different point of view .
She feels like she has no time to do anything .
Pythons ar n't exactly considered a common pet like a dog or a cat .
'If she told the truth , she would hurt her aunt .
cell 's come from cell 's
Thinking the pythons are this way because of what you read or have watched on tv .
The Transfer , the reading of the information , the sending of the proteins , and recieving
Mr.Leonard and Paul both had something in common , they had a hard time reading .
Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete , but not a good student .
goes through a step and then produces
Red blood cells carry oxygen around the blood stream .
Replication-
She is explaining it like it is what is best for the household .
There is Transporting of proteins.Also , proteins are checked and sent off .
mRNA leaves the nucleus the body starts another cycle another mRNA is produced mRNA leaves the cell
reproduction digestionneucleus
There are three types of ways that cells move substances across the concentration gradient .
And for what reason ?
Then the substances travel out of the cell .
Paul did n't want to not learn how to read .
Mr. Leonard was a great athelete but not a good student .
So the cell membran knows how to prevent future problems so the cell will stay stable .
Diffusion
'She 's always helping others , and i think that means she has patience .
the third is that they give proteins .
MRNATRNARNA
Pandas and koalas are both specialist species .
They both differ from the pythons because they are carnivores and pandas and Koalas are n't .
She is afraid to speak her mind
Determine the ending mass , determine the difference in mass .
'Money is n't everything . '
She is stressed she is constantly thinking and feeling overwhelmed
Also , the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation .
She feels like she has a ton of weight on her shoulders .
flagellumvacuolesrespiration
The four major steps of protein synthesis are cell respiration , meiosis , miosis , and cell division .
Unlike the python does not eat meat .
the entire year round .
The panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively .
It must have taken him a long time to figure out all of the fast about space .
FIGHTS INFECTIONS , MEIOSIS , MITOSES .
Rose is very stressed girl .
Osmosis
It is a tale-like structure .
That 's what a students conclusion would look like .
WHEN IT LEAVES THE CELL , IT LEAVES THROUGH RESPIRATION .
Rose is scared of hurting her aunt by telling the truth .
Anaphase , metaphase , telaphase , and prophase .
Part of that conversation reflets the effort Rose is putting into everything and how stressed she truely is .
b .
Finally , the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment .
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2 .
Rose talks to her sister Anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money .
When Rose talks to her Aunt she feels the same way as Rose does .
It makes paul ask why Mr. Leonard did not tell him this
In the story Rose feels depressed as if she has no way out .
The cell wall is barrier to sources outside of the cell and protects the cell .
After that , the DNA is replicated .
One the gain energy and the nthey use that energy to build up protein synthesis .
cell division , cellular respiration , cell wall
mRNA is the messengertRNA transports the RNArRNA relicates the RNAprotien synthesis is the product after the process
I could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her .
one of the processes is by
copyingmutating crossing overreading the cell
She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her . '
restract substute renew
It has at first a confusing effect .
something receives it4 .
it will be super dark .
Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data .
More information is needed , more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion .
Rose wants to help her Mom and her Aunt but she has alot on her mind .
it takes the message to the membrane
He gives souportive detaels about why its bad .
Rose suppressed her own feelings and talked to Anna like everything was going to be okay .
We even have invasive reptiles and invasive spieces .
The DNA unzips2 .
Invasive means that it basically goes away .
`` `` A specialist is china 's panda or Australia koalas bear .
Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling .
Those are the four major steps in protein syntheses .
the mRNA sends a message to the RNA to begin protein synthesis
Mitosis-lets things get in and outosmosis-water
black : : it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
Finally , the process ends and starts all over again .
1-The substances travel through the membrane in a normal fashion .
The RNA leaves the nucleus and then it goes into the cell membrane .
Rosie feel her life is dificult but she felt good because her aunt understodd how she felt .
This one thing is their diets . ''
Four ways are leaving to go to rRNA , disolving .
The major part is amino acids being apart of it and helping us have what we need to survive .
A panda in China is similar to a koala in Australia because they are both specialists .
tRNA , rRNA , gRNA ,
Reproduction- is produsing mre offsprings .
dark gray : :
Meaning by that , the fact stating , she has to write a three thousand word essay .
Rose has faith .
control the membrane control its movements
It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go . '
TRNA RNA DNA
It would involve replicating and dividing the cell to become two cells .
I think that quote from the story shows that she is overworked .
She says when she is talking to Anna she says 'Only if you have everything . '
there are two copies of DNA
Need to be reproduced to maintain the source .
The python does n't need only one thing to live off of because it is able to adapt .
TranslationReplicationTranstionAdaptation
Taking Ribosomes from the Rough ER to the golgi bodies is another .
The cytoplasm , flagullum , and the shape of the substances
In the story Mr. Leonard and Paul had started a conversation about if they were a good athlete .
When Mr. Leonard finds out Paul ca n't read he helps him get better at hurdles .
The mitochondrian transport energy throughout the cell .
It transfers the protein to the nucleus .
She really misses her dad .
1. active transport2 .
Diffusion , osmosis , fagela
They eat everything they want .
The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass .
The RNA divides into mRNA and then the mRNA goes out and gives coded instructions to the organelles .
The Red Blood Cells controll the blood coming from the heart to throughout the body.3 .
He is concerned about why Mr. leonard did n't tell him .
decomposing
This is what is making her so stressed .
1 .
It starts with history and then works it way forward , also starting small and making it seem bigger .
Anaphase is where they break out of the nucleus .
Another process is Miosis which splits the cells again , and the third process used by cells is Mutation .
The mRNA leaves , and transfers into tRNA ( because mRNA is the messenger RNA ) .
That is why `` '' invasive '' '' is the most significant part of the artical . ''
`` Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are `` '' specialist '' '' species .

So his hopes would n't come crashing down just because he could n't read .
Her dad is also in Los Angeles andher brother Paul is at college .
